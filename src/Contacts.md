# **CONTACTS**

========================================
You are who you know. In the shadows of the Sixth World, this is truer than you might want to believe. Contacts are NPCs who serve as sources of information, goods and services that keep shadowrunners alive and well. Often, they can’t get chip-truth about what they’ve gotten themselves into from anyone else.

- Every character receives free points to spend on their initial contacts equal to their **Charisma rating x3**.
- The cost of a contact is the sum of their Connection and Loyalty.
- A single contact may have no more than 7 points spent on them at character creation.
- There are no limits on how many contacts the character may purchase.

*You can spend karma to improve or add to your contacts. Each point of Connection or Loyalty costs 1 karma.*

There are two Ratings that measure just **how useful** a contact is: **Connection** and **Loyalty.**

**Connection**: this measures the contact’s influence. The higher the Connection Rating, the more juice the contact has. A character can start the game with contact of a **maximum Connection rating of 6**.

**Loyalty**: This shows how much you can trust the contact. The higher, the Loyalty Rating, the more the contact is willing to do for the PC. A character can start the game with contact of a **maximum Loyalty rating of 6**.

|**Connection**||
|:-|:-|
|***Rating***|*Description*|
|**1**|Virtually no social influence.|
|**2**|Has one or two friends with some Knowledge skills or some minor social influence.|
|**3**|Has a few friends, but not a lot of social influence.|
|**4**|Knows several people in a neighbourhood; a borough mayor or gang leader.|
|**5**|Knows several people and has a moderate degree of social influence; a city councilman or low-level executive in a small-to-medium corporation.|
|**6**|Known and connected across this state; a city/sprawl mayor or governor, notable fixer or mid-level executive in a medium-sized corporation.|

|**Loyalty**||
|:-|:-|
|***Rating***|*Description*|
|**1**|Just Biz: The relationship is purely mercenary, based solely on economics. The people involved may not even like each other and they won’t offer any sort of preferential treatment.|
|**2**|Regular: The relationship is still all business, but the parties treat each other with a modicum of mutual respect.|
|**3**|Acquaintance: The people in the relationship are friendly, but calling them actual friends might be stretching it. The contact is willing to be inconvenienced in small ways for the character but won’t take a fall for them.|
|**4**|Buddy: There’s actual friendship here, or at least solid mutual respect. The contact will do out of their way for the character if needed.|
|**5**|Got Your Back: The parties know and trust each other and have for some time. The contact will back the character even in risky situations.|
|**6**|Friend for Life: The contact and character will go to the wall for each other, if that’s what it takes.|

## **Using Contacts**

Friday night socials and a beer at the local bar are all well and good, but the real value of a contact is what they can do for you, and while these things are helpful, they rarely come for free. There are **six major things they can do**:

**Legwork**: Legwork is chasing down the data trail and answering questions that may not be found on the Matrix.

**Networking**: Networking is all about putting the right people in the same room, getting them to talk and hopefully launching them on a mutually beneficial relationship.

**Swag**: You want something, other people have it. With any luck, your contact is one of these other people. You also might be able to sell them some goods you picked up while on the job.

**Shadow Services**: This is a special kind of favour. Contact who perform this kind of service have a job to do and they’re using their skills on your behalf for a form of payment besides the usual cash.

**Personal Favours**: This is also a special kind of favour. These contacts have power, influence or are in a position of authority. You want them to use that to bend the rules, turn a blind eye or whisper in someone’s ear a suggestion.

**Support**: These contacts may not have power, a job that can be exploited or money you can borrow, but dammit, they’ve got your back. Some may have some talent, a cool you that you don’t know how to use or maybe they just have a place for you to crash. More often, support contacts are the friends and minor contacts that are not necessarily a big part of the shadowrunner’s business but play a role in the other aspects of their life.

### **What does a Contact Want?**

Contacts don’t do things for you out of the goodness of their hearts. Everything has a price. Payment doesn’t have to come in nuyen, but it has to come. Maybe it’s favour trading, maybe it’s helping the contact satisfy a particular vice or maybe it’s supplying critical data. Each contact has a transaction type they prefer and if their price isn’t met, the character owes the contact. If the price isn’t paid in a proper time frame, the contact’s going to notice and there will be consequences.

**Cash**: For many contacts, the almighty digital nuyen is acceptable, especially in transactions for services and goods. A service fee would of course be added to the price of the item or service depending on the relationship the contact has with the character and the effort to find the item.

**Services**: More often contacts will offer their support, service or intel for a character provided that the character in turn does a job for them. The services a contact may request can be grouped into the following categories: shadow work, contact-related work and drek jobs.

**Barter**: There are contacts who do not use a bank or nuyen to keep their electronic footprint at a minimum, so they favour trading for goods, keeping everything off-bank and off-book.

### **Sample Contacts**

|**“Tincan” Oscar**|Homeless Beggar|**Connection:** 1|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Troll|Male|16 year old|Alone|
|*Type: Legwork*|*Payment: BTL Chips, Food, Shelter*|||
|*Although he sometimes claims he used to be a fierce street samurai, there’s little evidence to support it. With a BTL addiction and a smell like beetles are using his beard as a cemetery, he’s not much to look at. But, for a small price, he’ll keep watch on a person or place for a while, hold on to something so the cops don’t find it or let you in on the latest gossip from the homeless. He’s pretty reliable, unless he gets his hand on another BTL chip – then all bets are off.*||||

|**Chas Shrevnitz**|Taxi Driver|**Connection:** 2|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Orc|Male|18 year old|Jump in my car|
|*Type: Shadow Services*|*Payment: Cred, Thrills, Car Parts*|||
|*There are plenty of places in Boston that Gridguide won’t go. Or taxi drivers. Or anyone not armed to the teeth. But Chas laughs at danger, while doing donuts in its front yard. He’ll drive you into a danger zone (for a price), just don’t expect him to hang around – or stop for you to get out. You can tuck and roll, right?*||||

|**April Bradbury**|Reporter|**Connection**: 2|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Human|Female|25 year old|Seeking true love|
|*Type: Legwork*|*Payment: Information, Interviews, Shadowrunner Job*|||
|*A reporter for the Boston Bulletin who’s hungry for her first big break. For the chance to get an exclusive interview or some juicy information that might get her a front-page byline, she’ll dig into the unreported information behind a person, place or event – using her network of contacts to tell you what wasn’t reported in the media.*||||

|**Holly Milano**|Club Hopper|**Connection**: 3|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elf|Female|21 year old (still)|Single and lovin’ it|
|*Type: Networking*|*Payment: Celebrity Connections, High Fashion Clothes, Clubbing Drugs*|||
|*This gorgeous young elf from a rich family grew up with parents who were too busy to know what she was up to most of the time. She lives to party, hitting the most fashionable clubs in the latest fashions and leaving a swathe of devastated suitors. A party girl like Holly can get into a surprising number of places without an invitation, make a reservation when everything’s booked out and get her hands on a wide variety of party favours.*||||

|**Gregory Hoo**|Street Doc|**Connection**: 3|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Human|Male|Older than you’ll live to be|Widowed|
|*Type: Shadow Services*|*Payment: Cred, Bioware, Cyberware*|||
|*An old, Asian man with a walking cane who has been a street doc for more years that you’ve been alive. He’s removed enough bullets from bodies to start an armoury and stitched so many injuries, he’ll give a tailor a run for their money. He’ll stitch you back together and, for the right price, hook you up with a few medical supplies.*||||

|**Charred Oak**|Decker|**Connection**: 3|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Matrix Persona|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown|
|*Type: Shadow Services*|*Payment: Information, Cred*|||
|*After leaving a coded message on certain message boards, contact with the matrix persona known as Charred Oak can be made. The lumbering treeman covered in burned bark and blackened branches seems dour but is able to track down a surprising amount of information from the Matrix in short order. From floorplans, to commlink contact details to reservations at exclusive restaurants, the decker can provide you with what you may not be able to come up with yourself.*||||

|**“Adder” Jackson**|Ganger|**Connection**: 4|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ork|Male|Twenties|In a relationship|
|*Type: Shadow Services*|*Payment: Drugs, Guns, Cred*|||
|*High up in the Red Vipers gang, “Adder” Jackson can have gang members provide fire support (not accurate, but loud and highly distracting), protect a vehicle (hang around it and rumble with any other gangers that try to steal or deface it) or safe passage and even a hideout in their territory for a short time (if you don’t mind the noise and the smell). He gained the moniker “Adder” for being the gangs unofficial accountant.*||||

|**Sorg Melton**|Fence|**Connection**: 4|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Human|Male|Middle-Aged|None o’ y’r business|
|*Type: Swag*|*Payment: Barter, Certified Credsticks*|||
|*Plutus Pawnshop, near the corner of Washington and East Berkeley Streets, is owned and operated by Sorg Melton. Despite insisting that he runs a “legitimate business”, you know he deals under-the-table, both buying and selling illegal and restricted goods as well as those that fell off the back of a truck or just need a few drops of blood cleaned off. While getting military-grade weaponry is probably beyond his means, there are many other pieces of gear that he can get his hands on, for a price.*||||

|**Walter Sewell**|Forger|**Connection**: 4|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elf|Male|Thirties|A mystery|
|*Type: Swag*|*Payment: Cred upfront*|||
|*Need a fake SIN, fake licence, fake security clearance. O’l Walt has you covered… if you have the cred. His prices might seem high, but he’s got access to a variety of IDs from the barely passable to something that has a chance of being accepted for entry to a nuclear power plant (not that you would ever need that -right?).*||||

|**Brigid Guerrero**|Knight Errant Captain|**Connection**: 5|**Loyalty:** Player choice|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dwarf|Female|Middle-Aged|Married|
|*Type: Personal Favours*|*Payment: Information, Shadowrun Services*|||
|*From beat-cop to detective to captain of the local precinct, Guerrero has been determined to make a difference. She’ll turn a blind eye, drop an investigation or keep the heat off for a while if you make it worth her while. But she’s not in it for cred. She wants action. She’ll trade in order to get the violent, dangerous criminals off the street – preferably with a toe tag.*||||
