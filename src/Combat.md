# **COMBAT**

## **Combat Turn Sequence**

Combat encounters occur in three-second **Combat Turns**.

During each **Combat Turn**, characters act in order determined by their **Initiative Score** (highest first, lowest last).

Initiative is fluid and changes both within a Combat Turn and between Combat Turns.

The character with the highest Initiative Score takes their **Action Phase** first. If there is a tie in Initiative Scores, compare the Attributes (Edge, Reaction, Intuition), with the highest going first. In the event this is still a tie, actions are determined simultaneously.

*Note*: **Wound modifiers** affect the **Initiative Score** as soon as the wound is inflicted.

In an **Action Phase**, a character may take two **Simple Actions** or one **Complex Action**. In addition, characters may take one **Bonus Action** each **Action Phase**. Characters may replace each **Simple Action** with an additional **Bonus Action**.

|**One Action Phase:**|||||||
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Complex Action|OR|Simple Action\*|OR|Simple Action|OR|Bonus Action|
|||Simple Action\*||Bonus Action||Bonus Action|
|Bonus Action||Bonus Action||Bonus Action||Bonus Action|

**Only one of these can be an Attack Action.*

When these actions are complete, reduce the character’s **Initiative Score** by 10. If the **Initiative Score** is zero or less, the character has completed their actions this **Combat Turn**.

A character can **Delay** their **Action Phase** to act later in the **Combat Turn**. Characters can choose to go after the last character’s Action Phase. When they decide to act, they replace their normal **Initiative Score** with the one on which they act, however actions they take may receive a -1 dice pool penalty.

## **Combat Movement**

Basic combat movement (walking) does not use an action. Running uses a Bonus Action. Sprinting is a Complex Action.

A character’s walk rate and run rate are determined by the table below. This is the distance they can move during their Combat Turn. As soon as a character exceeds their Walk Rate, they are considered Running until the end of the Combat Turn. Running characters must use a Bonus Action in each Initiative Pass they are considered running. Characters cannot exceed their Run Rate in a Combat Turn without making a Sprinting Test.

|**Metatype**|**Walk Rate**|**Run Rate**|**Sprint Increase**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Dwarf, Troll**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+1m/hit|
|**Elf, Human, Ork**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+2m/hit|

**Walking** (up to Walk Rate) – Free action – No modifiers.

**Running** (up to Run Rate) – Bonus action – Suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to all actions (except Sprinting Tests).

Ranged attacks against this character suffer a -2 dice pool penalty.

If a running character makes a charge into melee combat, they gain a +4 dice pool bonus (making a net bonus of +2 when combined with the general penalty).

**Sprinting** – Complex Action – Running + Strength [Physical] Test.

Characters are allowed a maximum number of Sprinting tests equal to half their Running Skill per Combat Turn (minimum 1).

Suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to all actions (except Sprinting Tests).

Ranged attacks against this character suffer a -4 dice pool penalty.

If you Sprint for multiple consecutive Combat Turns or during multiple Action Phases of the same Combat Turn, you risk taking fatigue damage. For every consecutive Action Phase or Combat Turn in which you use the Sprint action, you take a cumulative 1S DV of fatigue damage. If you’re only running, instead of sprinting, this damage is taken every 3 minutes.

## **Bonus Actions**

Bonus actions are relatively simple, nearly automatic actions that require little effort to accomplish. Examples include saying a phrase, dropping an object, gesturing or walking.

A character may take one Bonus Action during their own Action Phase or at some point later in the Initiative Pass. A character may only take a Bonus Action prior to their first Action Phase if they are not surprised. Multiple Bonus Actions may be allowed by the gamesmaster if the situation seems reasonable (e.g. dropping an object and speaking a phase).

**Drop Object**: A character may drop a held object as a Bonus Action. If holding an object in each hand, both objects may be dropped as a single Bonus Action.

**Drop Prone/Kneel**: A character may kneel or drop prone as a Bonus Action as long as they are not surprised.

**Gesture**: A character may communicate with a few quick gestures as a Bonus Action.

**Run**: Running uses a Bonus Action (see Combat Movement above).

**DNI Use Device**: A character may use a Bonus Action to activate, deactivate or switch the mode on a device they are linked to by a Direct Neural Interface (DNI). This includes changing the firing mode of a smart-linked firearm (safety, single shot, burst, full-auto). Note that it takes longer to interact with some devices, as noted in individual gear descriptions.

**Speak/Text/Transmit Phase**: One short phrase of verbal communication is a Bonus Action. Characters who are equipped to send text messages through their commlinks may also send short messages as a Bonus Action, longer if they are using a direct neural interface (DNI).

**Multiple Attacks**: A character may use a Bonus Action to attack multiple targets in a single action by splitting their dice pool. This action must be combined with a Fire Weapon Action, Throw Weapon Action, Melee Attack Action.

## **Simple Actions**

A Simple Action is one step more complicated than a Bonus Action and requires more concentration to attempt. During an Action Phase, a character may take two Simple actions, though **only one can be an attack action**. A character may also take a Bonus Action with each Simple action.

**Pick Up/Put Down Object**: A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one they were holding as a Simple Action. This action means that some care is taken to put the object down or pick it up. Just dropping an object is a Bonus Action, but items that get dropped are more likely to be damaged than items that are set down.

**Stand Up**: Using a Simple Action, a character who is lying down or prone may stand up. If the character is seriously wounded and attempting to stand, they may need to succeed in a Body + Willpower (2) Test to do so.

**Take Cover**: A character may use a Simple Action to take cover behind nearby objects or terrain, gaining a cover bonus to their defence test, as long as they are not surprised.

**Take Aim**: A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow or throwing weapon as a Simple Action. The benefits of a taking aim are lost if the character takes any other kind of action – including a Bonus Action – at any time before attacking. Taking aim applies a +1 dice pool modifier *or* a +1 Accuracy increase to the Attack Test.

If the character is using image magnification or a targeting scope, Take Aim must be used to line up the shot in order to receive the bonus from the item.

**Use Device**: A character may use a Simple Action to activate, deactivate or switch the mode on a device through a control device such as a commlink. This includes changing the firing mode of a firearm (safety, single shot, burst, full-auto). Note that it takes longer to interact with some devices, as noted in individual gear descriptions.

**Ready Weapon**: A character may ready a weapon as a Simple Action. The weapon may be a firearm, melee weapon, throwing weapon, ranged weapon or mounted or vehicular weapon. Readying entails drawing a firearm from a holster, drawing a throwing or melee weapon from a sheath, picking up any kind of weapon or generally preparing any kind of weapon for use. A weapon must be ready before it can be used. Weapons not held in a traditional holster may require a Complex Action to ready at the gamesmaster’s discretion.

A character may ready a number of small throwing weapons, such as throwing knives or shuriken, equal to half their Agility (round up) per Ready Weapon action.

**Quick Draw**: A character may attempt to quick-draw a light-pistol, light-pistol-sized weapon or small throwing weapon and immediately fire it by using a Quick Draw Simple Action. For a character to successfully draw the weapon, the player must make a (Weapon Skill) + Reaction [Physical] (3) Test. If the test is successful, the character draws the weapon and fires as a single Simple Action. If the test fails, the weapon is drawn but cannot be fired with the same action. If there is a glitch, the weapon is stuck in the holster or dropped and no more actions are allowed. In a critical glitch, a drawn blade may be fumbled out of the character’s reach or a pistol accidentally fired while still in the holster; the gamemaster decides the exact nature of the screw-up. Two weapons may be quick-drawn and fired simultaneously, but the dice pool is split and off-hand penalties apply.

**Fire Bow\***: Firing a single arrow from a loaded bow is a Simple Action.

**Fire Firearm\***: A character may fire a readied firearm in single-shot, burst-fire, semi-automatic or full-auto mode as a Simple Action.

>**\* The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**

If a character has one weapon in each hand, they may fire both at once by also expending a Bonus Action. The off-hand modifier applies. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

When taken as Simple Actions, burst-fire fires 3 bullets, while full-auto fire 6 bullets.

**Reload Bow**: To nock a single arrow is a Simple Action.

**Remove Clip**: It is a Simple Action to remove a clip from a ready firearm and stash it in a readily available location.

**Reload Clip**: It is a Simple Action to grab a readily available fresh clip and slam it into the weapon.

**Throw Weapon**: A character may throw a ready throwing weapon as a Simple Action. **The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**.

Multiple readied throwing weapons (up to half your relevant Combat Skill) can be thrown at a target within Short or Medium range by also expending a Bonus Action. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

**Shift Perception**: A character capable of Astral Perception may shift perception to or from Astral Space as a Simple Action.

**Activate Focus**: A character may activate a focus they are carrying with a Simple Action.

**Call Spirit**: A character may call a spirit that has already been summoned and placed on standby as a Simple Action.

**Command Spirit**: Issuing a command to a single spirit or group of spirits under a summoner’s control is a Simple Action.

**Dismiss Spirit**: Freeing a spirit from your control is a Simple action. It does not immediately send the spirit back to its home plane but instead frees it to do as it chooses.

## **Complex Actions**

A Complex Action requires intense concentration and/or finesse. Only one Complex Action is possible per Action Phase.

**Sprint**: A character may use a Complex action to increase their Running Rate and making a Sprinting Test.

**Escape Combat**: With a little room to move, agile character can avoid the Interception attempts of their opponents without engaging in combat. Using a Complex Action with their movement, they can make an Agility + Acrobatics (2) [Physical] Test. Each hit above the threshold allows the character to move past one opponent.

**Fire Mounted or Vehicle Weapon**: A character may fire a previously readied mounted or vehicle weapon by taking a Complex Action.

**Rigger Jump In**: A character with a Vehicle Control Rig (VCR) and rigger adapted vehicle may jump in to control the vehicle with a Complex Action.

**Reload Firearm**: Weapons that are belt fed, break action, cylinder, drum, internal magazine, muzzle loaders or use a speed loader are reloaded using a Complex action.

**Melee Attack**: A character may make a melee attack as a Complex Action. **The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**. A character may also attack multiple targets within melee range by also expending a Bonus Action. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

**Melee Teamwork**: A character may make an Opposed Melee + Agility [Physical] v Intuition Test to give the next melee attacker a bonus equal to their net hits. The next ally could instead use these hits as a bonus on their own Melee Teamwork Test, hoping to build the amount of hits they are passing on to the eventual attacker. Three Melee Teamwork attacks can be made before a standard attack must be made. This is a good option for less-skilled attackers to help out their melee-oriented teammates.

**Fire Full-Auto Weapon**: A character may fire a readied firearm in Full-Auto fire mode with a Complex Action. When fired as a Complex Action, Full-Auto uses 10 bullets. Remember the effects of cumulative recoil when using these fire modes. And good fragging luck!

**Fire Long Burst or Semi-Auto Burst**: A character may fire a readied firearm in a Long Burst or Semi-Auto Burst with a Complex Action. Remember the effects of cumulative recoil with using these fire modes.

A character may attack multiple targets within Short or Medium range by also expending a Bonus Action. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

If a character has one weapon in each hand, they may fire both at once by also expending a Bonus Action. The off-hand modifier applies.

**Astral Projection**: A character capable of Astral Projection may shift their consciousness to the astral plane as a Complex Action.

**Manifest**: A character may manifest or unmanifest their astral form as a Complex Action.

**Banish Spirit**: A character may enter into a Banishing contest with a spirit as a Complex Action.

**Cast Spell**: A character may cast a spell as a Complex Action.

**Summoning**: A character may summon a spirit to assist them with a Complex Action.

## **Interrupt Actions**

Interrupt Actions are taken outside a character’s Action Phase. A character may only take an Interrupt Action prior to their first Action Phase if they are not surprised. When these actions are complete, reduce the character’s **Initiative Score** by the amount listed. If a character does not have enough Initiative remaining, they cannot take an Interrupt Action. If the **Initiative Score** is reduced to zero or less, the character has completed their actions this **Combat Turn**.

**Block**: -5 Initiative. A character may choose to use their own unarmed combat skill to block incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action. Add the character’s Unarmed Combat Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

**Parry**: -5 Initiative. A character may choose to use their own melee combat skill to deflect incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. Add the character’s Melee Weapon Skill Rating to their Defence Test. Bonus die, such as from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test.

**Dodge**: -5 Initiative. A character may choose to use their own acrobatics skill to dodge incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. Add the character’s Acrobatics Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

**Intercept**: -0 Initiative. A character may take an Interrupt Action to intercept an opponent who attempts to move past them, break out of melee combat or fire a ranged weapon in melee combat. Prone combatants cannot intercept. The Intercept Action allows a character to make a melee attack out of turn (this may be an unarmed attack). If a character is wielding a firearm, they may choose to strike with it as a club using the Club skill. If, after their Resistance Test, the character attempting to pass takes damage equal to their Body, they are intercepted and cannot continue their movement.

**Full Defence**: -10 Initiative. A character may choose to focus on deliberately avoiding incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. This action adds the character’s Willpower to their Defence Tests for the entire Combat Turn. This bonus is also cumulative with other Interrupt Actions. Full Defence actions may be taken at any time, even before the character’s Action Phase as an Interrupt Action, as long as the character is not surprised.

## **Combat Resolution**

Combat is handled as an Opposed Test between the attacker and defender. The attacker rolls Combat Skill + Attribute +/- modifiers [Limit]. Ranged weapons have an Accuracy score that acts as a Limit for that weapon. Weapons that are in poor condition or broken may have their Accuracy reduced. Melee weapons use the Inherent Limit [Physical] and do not have an Accuracy rating, although improvised weapons may incur an Accuracy penalty (e.g. -1 for a golf club or frying pan and -2 for a bar stool or a bench). Unarmed attacks use the Inherent Limit [Physical] and do not have an Accuracy rating.

A standard Defence Test (Reaction + Intuition) does not take any actions (although the defender can choose to Dodge, Parry, Block or go on Full Defence). If the attacker scores more hits than the defender, the attack hits the target. On a tie, there is a grazing hit which does not do any damage, but allows certain contact-only attacks (poisons, shocks, touch-only combat spells, etc) to trigger their effects.

## **Combat Modifiers**

If the defender is inside a moving vehicle, they gain a +3 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If the defender is prone, they suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to their defence. This modifier does not apply to defending against ranged attacks unless the attacker is extremely close (5 metres of less).

If the attacker has longer Reach, the defender suffers a -1 dice pool penalty to their defence for each point of net Reach.

If the attacker has an ally engaged in the same melee, they gain a +1 dice pool bonus to their attack test.

If the defender has defended against a previous attack they suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to their defence for each previous attack.

If the defender is running, they receive a +2 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If the defender has partial cover, they receive a +2 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If the defender has good cover, they receive a +2 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If a defender is in melee and the target of a ranged attack, they suffer a -3 dice pool penalty to their defence against the ranged attack.

If an attacker is making a ranged attack while in melee combat, they suffer a -3 penalty to their attack rolls.

If making an attack at a Micro target (Insect, Microdrone) -3

If making an attack at a Mini target (Small Rodents, Minidrones) -2

If making an attack at a Small target (Cat, Small Drone) -1

If making an attack at a Large target (Horse, Car) +1

If making an attack at a Huge target (Dump Truck, Wyvern) +2

## **Armour**

Armour is used with the Body attribute to make Damage Resistance Tests. Add the attacker’s net hits to the DV of the weapon to determine the modified Damage Value (DV).

The Armour Rating of the armour is modified by the attack’s Armour Penetration (AP) value.  If the modified (DV) of an attack causing Physical damage is less than the AP-modified armour rating, then the attack causes Stun damage instead of Physical damage.

If a character is wearing more than one piece of armour at a time, the value of the highest armour piece applies for determining Armour. As long as the modified Armour Value is positive, the defender rolls Body + modified Armour to resist damage. Otherwise, the defender only rolls Body.

Each hit scored reduces the modified DV by 1. If the DV is reduced to 0 or less, no damage is inflicted. Remaining DV is applied to the target’s Condition Monitor. Each point of DV equals 1 box of damage. Wound Modifiers may come into effect as a result of the damage (see below). Characters may also need to check for knockdown.

## DERIVED VALUES

**Defence Test**: Reaction + Intuition.

**Block**: Add the character’s Unarmed Combat Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

**Parry**: Add the character’s Melee Weapon Skill Rating to their Defence Test. Bonus die, such as from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test.

**Dodge**: Add the character’s Acrobatics Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

## **Knockdown**

If a character takes more damage from a single attack than their Physical Limit (Stun or Physical, after a Damage Resistance Test) then the attack knocks them down. Any character who takes 10 or more damage after a Resistance Test in a single attack is always knocked down.

Some weapons (such as Gel Rounds) reduce the amount of damage needed to determine knockdown.

If a character is seriously wounded and attempting to stand, they must succeed in a Body + Willpower (2) Test to do so (wound modifiers apply to this test).

## **Damage**

Damage in *Shadowrun* is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage if tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

Physical damage has a “P” following the Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal. The number of boxes in the Physical Condition Monitor equals (Body /2) +8.

Stun damage has an “S” following the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal. The number of boxes in the Stun Condition Monitor equals (Willpower /2) +8.

## **Wound Modifiers**

Wound modifiers are accumulated with every third box of damage and are cumulative between damage tracks and with other negative modifiers such as spells or adverse conditions. Wound modifiers are applied to all tests except those about reducing the number of boxes you’re about to take on your Condition Monitor (such as damage resistance, resisting direct combat spells, toxin resistance, and so on). The Wound Modifier penalty is also applied to a character’s Initiative modifier and Initiative Score during combat.

## **Exceeding the Condition Monitor**

When the total number of boxes in a damage track (Physical or Stun) are filled in and damage still remains to be applied, one of two things happen:

- - If the damage is Stun, it carries over into the Physical damage track. For every two full boxes of excess Stun damage, carry over 1 box to the Physical damage track.
- - If a character takes more Physical damage than they have boxes of Physical damage, they are near death. If the damage overflows by more than the character’s Body attribute they die.

Characters also take an additional box of damage every (Body) minutes while they have overflow damage.

## **Fatigue Damage**

Fatigue damage is Stun damage you incur through doing something strenuous or for being in the middle of something stressful. It’s caused by harsh environments, hard exertion and drek like that. Fatigue damage is resisted with Body + Willpower, not with armour. Fatigue damage cannot be healed while the condition causing it still exists.

## **USING FIREARMS**

Guns, guns, guns!!! Firearms come in a variety of shapes and sizes but they all do pretty much the same thing: throw high-velocity projectiles designed to damage whatever they hit. Whether this is spraying lead downrange or firing a single high-precision shot, the results can be deadly. Which, generally, is the plan.

### **Firing Modes**

The first thing we need to look at when it comes to firearms in the firing mode. A weapon’s firing mode determines how quickly each round is ready to fire, how quickly you can pull the trigger and what happens when you do.

|**Mode**|**Attack**|**Action**|**DV**|**Defence Mod.**|**Rounds Used**|**Recoil**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Single-Shot (SS)**|Single Shot|Simple|0|0|1|No Recoil|
|**Semi-Automatic (SA)**|Single Shot|Simple|0|0|1|1|
||Double Tap|Simple|+1|0|2|2|
||Semi-Automatic Burst (SB)|Complex|0|-2|3|3|
|**Burst-Fire (BF)**|Burst Fire (BF)|Simple|0|-2|3|3|
||Aimed Burst|Simple|+1|0|3|3|
|**Full-Auto (FA)**|Full-Auto|Simple|0|-5|6|6|
||Long Full-Auto (LFA)|Complex|0|-9|10|10|
||Suppressive Fire|Complex||||No Recoil|

#### **Single Shot (SS)**

Firing a Single Shot (SS) weapon uses a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attacking Simple Action in the same Action Phase. SS weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Bonus Action if the attacker is wielding two such weapons. Single Shot weapons include bolt-action rifles, single-action revolvers, pump-action shotguns, lever-action rifles and some large weapons that need extra time to chamber a fresh round due to the cartridge’s size.

Single Shot fire assumes another round is readied with each shot as long as rounds are available in the gun.

Single Shot (SS) weapons do not suffer from cumulative recoil when fired in single shot mode. Recoil penalties apply when using the Multiple Attacks Action.

***[Attack] Single Shot*    *Defence Modifier 0 Rounds Used 1   Recoil -***
[Simple Action] A single shot at the target.

#### **Semi-Automatic (SA)**

Semi-automatic weapons fire a round every time the trigger is pulled and automatically chamber a fresh round after each shot. Semi-automatic weapons fire a single round with a Simple Action but cannot combine that with any other Attack Action in the same Action Phase. Semi-automatic weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Bonus Action if the shooter has two semi-automatic weapons.

They also have the option of using a Semi-Automatic Burst.

***[Attack] Single Shot*    *Defence Modifier 0 Rounds Used 1   Recoil 1***

[Simple Action] A single shot at the target.

***[Attack] Double Tap*  *DV +1*  *Defence Modifier 0 Rounds Used 2   Recoil 2***

[Simple Action] A rapid pair of well-aimed shots fired to increase damage instead of making it harder to avoid.

***[Attack] Semi-Automatic Burst (SB)*  *Defence Modifier -2 Rounds Used 3   Recoil 3***

[Complex Action] Semi-Automatic Burst mode is three semi-automatic shots taken in quick succession. Semi-Automatic weapons can fire a burst of three rounds with a Complex Action. With more shots going downrange, they increase the chance that a bullet will hit.

#### **Burst Fire (BF)**

Burst Fire (BF) weapons are usually SMGs or assault rifles but some pistols and shotguns can be modified for this mode. In burst-fire mode, a gun rapidly fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled. Firing a weapon in Burst Fire mode is a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attack Simple Action in the same Action Phase.

***[Attack] Burst Fire*    *Defence Modifier -2 Rounds Used 3   Recoil 3***

[Simple Action] A Burst Fire Action fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled.

***[Attack] Aimed Burst*  *DV +1*  *Defence Modifier 0 Rounds Used 3   Recoil 3***

[Simple Action] An Aimed Burst Action fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled.

#### **Full-Auto (FA)**

Weapons that can fire in Full-Auto (FA) mode can throw bullets for as long as the attacker keeps the trigger pulled and the rounds last. Full-Auto weapons can be fired as a Simple Action, firing 6 bullets.

***[Attack] Full-Auto (FA)   Defence Modifier -4 Rounds Used 6   Recoil 6***

[Simple Action] Full-Auto (FA), firing 6 bullets.

***[Attack] Long Full-Auto (LFA)  Defence Modifier -6 Rounds Used 10  Recoil 10***

[Complex Action] Long Full-Auto (LFA), firing 10 bullets.

### **Recoil**

Recoil is the effect firing a gun has on the weapon and the wielder. Muzzle rise, wrist strain, body shifting and other factors caused by repeated firing of a weapon are all factors in recoil.

Recoil becomes more of a strain the more bullets you shoot. If you are firing two guns at the same time, shots from the one affect the other, so bullets from each gun add to your total recoil value.

Recoil compensation reduces the recoil penalty. You begin with 1 point of recoil compensation and then add your Strength/3 (rounded up) and the recoil compensation of guns you shoot. Subtract any bullets you’re about to fire from your recoil compensation. If the number is a negative number, that’s your recoil penalty; subtract the penalty from your dice pool before you roll for the attack.

When making multiple firearm attacks in a single Action Phase, calculate the total recoil penalty based on the bullets to be fired that round and remove it from your dice pool before splitting the pool for the multiple attacks.

#### **Progressive Recoil**

Recoil accumulates with every bullet fired until the attacker stops firing to bring the gun (or guns) back under control. Recoil penalties are cumulative over every Action Phase and Combat Turn unless the character takes, or is forced into, a Simple or Complex Action other than shooting. Recoil is cumulative to the character, not the weapon they’re firing. Recoil accumulates from every shot the character takes, not just from the firing of the same weapon.

### **Shotguns**

Shotguns fire slug rounds or shot rounds. Shot rounds spread when fired and the target gets a -1 dice pool modifier for defence at all ranges. To determine the damage done by shot rounds, apply the flechette ammunition rules to the DV indicated for the weapon.
