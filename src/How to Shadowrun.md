# **HOW TO SHADOWRUN**

Diving into a new RPG system can be daunting, so here’s a recommended approach to getting to know this edition of Shadowrun in a manageable way:

## **STEP 1 – Get to know the universe (a little)**

Obtain a rough idea of the Shadowrun universe, i.e. the setting of this RPG. The lore of this universe is *very, very* detailed – don’t feel like you need to know everything. Knowing “a little about a lot” will go a long way here. Here are some starter concepts to learn *a little* about:

- History in the Shadowrun universe was the same as IRL up to what year?
- What is Goblinification?
- What role does magic play in this universe?
- What is The Matrix?
- What are Megacorporations?  
- What are Shadowrunners and what role do they play?

## **STEP 2 – Get to know the game play mechanics (a little)**

Read through the “BASIC GAMEPLAY MECHANICS” section of this rulebook. This will help you understand the actual in-game impact of the various decisions to be made during character creation.

## **STEP 3 – Get to know the various character elements (a little)**  

It’s important not to *commit* to any character ideas yet. First, gain a basic understanding of Shadowrun character creation by skimming through a few key sections of this rulebook, listed below. As you skim, you might like to consider the broad type/s of character/s you might enjoy playing, but don’t set anything in stone.

- Metatypes
- Attributes
- Skills
- Magic & Technomancy Traits
- Decking/Rigging (see “The Matrix” section)
- Cyberware and Bioware

## **STEP 4 – Consult the party**

At this stage, it pays to consult with your fellow players. Discuss the characters you’re each interested in playing and see if you can agree upon a variety of different roles/skills, avoiding too much overlap and covering a range of abilities.

**Consider party roles/skills like:**

- The “face”
- Stealth
- Ranged damage
-  Melee damage
- Non-lethal takedowns
- Breaking and entering
- Disabling security systems
- Hacking
- Healing
- Countering magical threats
- Investigation
- Driving / piloting
- Drone control
- Underworld knowledge

### **STEP 5 – Character creation**

Once you’ve got a more solid idea for a character that a.) you’d like to play and b.) will work within your party, you can start creating your character.

**Before** diving into the full “crunch” of the character sheet and worrying about how point buy works etc., consider the following questions in this order first. Copy/paste this table to take rough notes as you go.  

| | |
| :---: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Do you want your character to be **magical, a technomancer, or neither?**                                       |                                                                           |
| **2** | Which **Skills** do you want your character to have?                                                            | Definitely want these: Would like these: These would be a cool/fun bonus: |
| **3** | Which **Attributes** will best support these skills?                                                            | Definitely: Some points in these would also be good:                      |
| **4** | Are there any particular **Metatype/s (or Metavariant/s)** that have strengths or bonuses in those Attribute/s? |                                                                           |


Now you’re ready (well, as you’ll ever be!) to dive into the crunch. Open up your character sheet and complete it by starting with the “Character Creation” section of this rulebook and working your way forward from there. Breaking this up into more than one session is a good idea. Once you reach the end of “Equipment”, including “Vehicles”, you’re done!

### **STEP 6 – Check you’ve covered everything**
