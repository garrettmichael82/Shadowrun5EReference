# MOVEMENT


Getting from one place to another, especially from one piece of cover to another or closing the distance on an opponent, is important. Characters have three types of movement: Walking, Running and Sprinting.

A character’s movement for an entire Combat Turn (meaning total movement for *all* Initiative Passes, not *each* Initiative Pass) is based on their Run Rate, which is determined by metatype. Walk rate determines the farthest a character can move during a Combat Turn before they are considered to be Running.

It’s important to point out that “run” does not mean bolt as fast as you can; that’s sprinting. Think of running as a trained combat hustle or a jog, something to get you to another point quickly but still leave you able to perform other actions, albeit with a penalty. Sprinting is exactly that, running as fast as you can from point A to point B.

|**Metatype**|**Walk Rate**|**Run Rate**|**Sprint Increase**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Dwarf, Troll**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+1m/hit|
|**Elf, Human, Ork**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+2m/hit|

### **Standard Movement**

**Walking and running**: The Movement Rates (Walk and Run) for each metatype are the distance the character can move during their Combat Turn. As soon as the character exceeds their Walk rate, they are considered Running until the end of the Combat Turn and incur any penalties or benefits of running. Running characters must use a Bonus Action each Initiative Pass they are considered running.

Characters cannot exceed their calculated Run Rate in a Combat Turn without making a Sprinting Test.

#### **Running Modifiers:**

Characters who are running take a -2 dice pool penalty to all actions performed while running (except for Sprinting).

Characters charging into melee combat gain a +4 dice pool bonus (making a net bonus of +2 when combined with the general penalty for running) when running into melee combat.

Characters making a ranged attack against a running opponent suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to their attack test.

Characters making a ranged attack against a sprinting opponent suffer a -4 dice pool penalty to their attack test.

### **Sprinting**

Characters may attempt to increase their running distance by performing a Sprint Action during their Action Phase. In this action, they make a Running + Strength [Physical] Test. Each hit increases the distance a character can move in a Combat Turn by either 1 metre (for dwarves and trolls) or 2 metres (for elves, humans and orks). Characters are allowed a maximum number of Sprinting Tests equal to half their Running skill per Combat Turn (rounded up). Sprinting characters also suffer fatigue if they sprint for too long.

### **Swimming**

Swimming is a Complex Action. A swimming character can move a number of metres in a Combat turn equal to the average of their Agility and Strength. You can take a Bonus Action to “sprint” with a Swimming + Strength [Physical] Test, adding 1 metre per hit or 2 metres per hit if you’re an elf or troll. Swimming on the surface of water or under it does not affect this rate of speed. As with the Running skill, swimmers suffer from fatigue after an extended time.

If you’re just trying to keep afloat, you can tread water. You can tread water for a number of minutes equal to the average of your Strength and Body rating. At the end of this time, make a Simple Swimming + Strength [Physical] (2) Test. Success means you can keep treading water for the same amount of time before another test; failure means you slip and take 1 box of Stun damage that you can’t resist.

### **Jumping**

Jumping is done from a running or standing position. Running leaps get more distance than standing jumps do, if you have enough room to get up to full speed. Make an Acrobatics + Agility Test, applying any appropriate modifiers. You jump a base distance of 20 centimetres multiplied by the total of your Agility and Strength and for every hit you get on this test, you jump 40 centimetres from a standing jump or 80 centimetres from a running jump in addition to. No matter how many hits you get, you can’t jump farther than your Agility x1.3 metres (net hits beyond this mean you did it with *style*).

For a vertical jump, it’s the same test, but with base height of 5 centimetres multiplied by the total of your Agility and Strength and for every hit you get on this test, you jump 5 centimetres higher.

### **Climbing**

The Acrobatics skill is applied to both *assisted* and *unassisted* climbing tasks. Assisted climbing is accomplished with specialised gear such as ropes and harnesses. Assisted climbing is easier and safer but requires more preparation. Unassisted climbing may be done on the fly, because you can climb without any gear. Climbing is a Complex Action and the number of hits you get on your Acrobatics + Strength [Physical] Test determines how far you can move vertically or laterally during your climb.

**Rappelling**: Rappelling is a gear-aided descent at near free-fall speed. This technique requires an Acrobatics + Body [Physical] (2) Success Test. So long as you have the proper gear and training, you can brake at any point in the descent, slow your speed and land safely. Rappelling expends a Simple Action, during which you fall at a rate of 20 metres per Combat Turn. Rappelling characters can increase the number of metres descended during that same Combat Turn by 1 for each net hit beyond the threshold on the Rappelling Test. If you take another Simple Action in the same phase, such as firing a weapon, you get a -2 dice pool penalty to both that action and the Rappelling Test. Stopping requires another Rappelling Test with the same threshold. On an unsuccessful test, you don’t slow down and may take damage if you hit the ground at speed.

|**Climbing Table**||
| :- | :- |
|**Situation**|**Movement Distance**|
|Assisted climbing down (rappelling)|20 metres +1 metre per hit|
|Assisted climbing upward|1 metre per hit|
|Assisted climbing horizontally|1 metre per 2 hits|
|Assisted climbing upside down (on a ceiling or overhang)|1 metre per 3 hits|
|Unassisted climbing upward|1 metre per 2 hits|
|Unassisted climbing down|1 metre per hit|
|Situation|Dice Pool Modifier|
|Assisted Climbing|+2|
|*Surface is:*||
|Easily climbable (chain-link fence)|+1|
|Broken (tree, loose stone wall)|+0|
|Flat (brick wall, side of old building)|-3|
|Sheer (metal wall, seamless stone)|-5|
|Slippery or wet|-2|
|Greased or gel-treated|-4|

### **Falling**

When a character falls more than three metres, they take Physical damage with a DV equal to the number of metres fallen, with an AP of -4. Use Body + Armour to resist this damage. The DV may be modified by a soft landing surface.

Falling characters drop 50 metres in the first Combat Turn, 100 metres in the second Combat Turn, 150 metres in the third Combat Turn and 200 metres every Combat Turn after that. Terminal velocity for a falling body is about 200 metres per turn.
