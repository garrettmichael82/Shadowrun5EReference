### **Skill Karma Cost**

>*\*Knowledge and Language Skills are first purchased based on their own points system – see “Knowledge and Language Skills” below. The above Karma points can be spent to purchase additional Knowledge Skills and/or Languages, if desired.*

### **What the Ratings Mean**

**Rating 0 - Untrained**: The default level of knowledge. Though untrained, you have a general awareness of the skill and occasionally may even be able to fake it.

**Rating 1 - Beginner**: You have a little training about how it works, but not always why it works.

**Rating 2 - Novice**: You’re a hobbyist, but not an enthusiast.

**Rating 3 - Competent**: You’re skilled at basic operations but struggle with complex operations and “tricks”.

**Rating 4 - Proficient**: You’re comfortable with what you do and perform well under normal pressures. Professional level for most jobs.

**Rating 5 - Skilled**: You know how to handle yourself in unfamiliar situations and can get creative when solving problems.

**Rating 6 - Professional**: You could easily sell your skills on the open market. This is the usual **maximum skill level for starting player characters.**

**Rating 7 - Veteran**: You’ve seen a lot of what the skill can do and what it can’t. Other people ask you how to do it.

### **Skill Groups**

Skill Groups are a collection of skills based around a core concept. You can purchase a skill group for less than it costs to take all the skills in the group individually. Having a skill group at a certain rating is the same as having all the skills in the skill group at that rating.

Skill group advancement uses special rules. If you want to advance one skill from the group without advancing the rest, the skill group is broken and you get each of the skills in the group at the former group rating; then you can increase one of the skills. If you want to get the skill group back (or get a new one), you must first get all the skills in the group to the same rating.

### **Specialisations**

If you devote extra time to a subset of a skill, it’s called a specialisation. A specialisation adds a +2 dice pool modifier to any test made for that skill when the specialisation comes into play. Characters can have multiple specialisations within the same skill, but only one applies at a time. New characters may only take one specialisation per skill at character creation, but you can buy more later. If you want a specialisation in a skill, you need a rating of at least 1 in that skill. Specialisations are not allowed for skill groups. A specialisation costs 7 karma.

### **Defaulting**

It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can **default** the skill, making the test using only the attribute to form the dice pool. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default – quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a -1 dice pool modifier in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Some skills are too technically demanding to be defaulted. These are mentioned in the skill description.

- Once these points have been spent, players can purchase additional Knowledge and/or Language skills, if desired, using Karma, per “Skill Karma Cost” table above.

> \**Two, if your character has taken the Bilingual quality.*

**Knowledge and Language skills** otherwise work in the same manner as all other Skills: they have corresponding numerical **ratings** to represent skill proficiency (see “What the Ratings Mean” above) and this rating is combined with an associated Attribute to determine the dice pool for tests.

**Knowledge and Language Skills points cost:** **1 bonus point per skill rating** (see “What the Ratings Mean” above)\
*(E.g. Rating 2 in Astronomy = 2 bonus points)*

### **Language Skills**

- Language skills use **Intuition** as their linked Attribute.

### **Knowledge Skills**

There are four types of Knowledge skills:

- **Academic** knowledge is information gained through formal education, whether from a school, tutor, university or other structured program.
- **Interests** include hobbies, experiences and personal interests of the individual character.
- **Professional** knowledge comes from an employer or professional organisation.
- **Street** knowledge includes everything a runner has picked up from life in the shadows, from drug prices to gang politics who pays the most for stolen goods.

When purchasing knowledge skills, a player should note which of these categories the skill belongs to so they know which **attribute** (see below) they will need to roll on their Knowledge Tests. Sometimes, Knowledge skills may straddle multiple categories. In these cases, choose the most appropriate category for the knowledge skill based on the character and how they would use it. For example, a Corporations Knowledge skill could fit in Professional, Academic or Street categories; a neo-anarchist with this skill would likely be focused on how corporate activities affect life on the street, so for this character it would be a Street skill, while for a boardroom executive it would be Professional.
