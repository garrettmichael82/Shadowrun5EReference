# METATYPES

## **Human**

**Human *(Homo sapiens sapiens)*** is the metatype that has been around the longest. You know them, you love them and if you’re reading this there’s a high probability that you are one. They are balanced in their abilities and tend to have a little larger portion of luck (represented by Edge) than other metatypes. **(Cost = 0 Karma)**

## **Dwarf**

**Dwarfs *(Homo sapiens pumilionis)***, as you may guess, are shorter and stockier than humans. They tend to be quite strong and very resilient, able to recover from damage ranging from knocks to the head to doses of hemlock. Or knocks to the head with a club wrapped in hemlock leaves. Dwarves are hard workers and tend to be highly valued by corporations, which means they are more deeply integrated into human society than the other metatypes. They still face discrimination due to their size and they often have to take steps to make a world built for humans suitable for them. **(Cost = 50 Karma)**

### **Metavariant subspecies: Gnome**

The gnome variant of the ***Homo sapiens pumilionis***, subspecies maintains the standard thermographic vision, slightly pointed aural helix and extended lifespan of the primary subspecies. Where the subspecies varies physically is in body hair, lessened height and musculature. The gnome metavariant lacks the distinctive body hair of their primary species; in fact, they lack all body hair except for head hair which is usually dark brown or black. Though standard dwarves are short of stature, gnomes are smaller still, with heights rarely exceeding 1.0 metre, averaging only 85 centimetres. Body masses average under 30 kilograms due to the metatype’s dense musculature. This dense muscle on a smaller frame allows gnomes a strength greater than one would expect, though still less than a standard human. **(Cost = 50 Karma)**

## **Elf**

**Elves *(Homo sapiens nobilis)*** are taller than humans, thinner and have pointed ears. They have an extremely annoying knack for being more nimble than humans and they generally are better looking to boot. They also have very long lifespans and continue to look young into their forties and fifties. They have occasionally been known to lord those facts over humans or anyone who comes within hearing range. **(Cost = 40 Karma)**

### **Metavariant subspecies: Forest Elf**

The forest elf metavariant possesses the same primary physical characteristics of the *nobilis* metatype, with a slight decrease in their average height. The only extensive variation is in their skin. Their epidermal layer integrates sections of cells containing chloroplasts as well as body hair similar to grass. These organelles employ chlorophyll to produce energy through plant-like photosynthesis. **Cost = (50 Karma)**

## **Ork**

**Orks *(Homo sapiens robustus)*** look like the creatures that have been dying by the score in fantasy movies and trideos for almost one hundred and fifty years. With protruding brows, prominent tusks and a large stature, orks have trouble avoiding the stereotype of being unthinkingly violent brutes. It doesn’t help that there are more than a few orks who are happy to live up to that stereotype rather than fight it. The end result is a certain underlying tension between orks and humans, which leads to both groups often preferring to live in separate communities. Elves and orks, on the other hand, often prefer to live in entirely separate countries. Despite the stereotypes, orks can be found in all walks of life, from dank alleys to corporate boardrooms. They have a shorter lifespan than humans, which often leads to them having a certain desperation to pack as much living into their years as they can. **(Cost = 50 Karma)**

### **Metavariant subspecies: Ogre**

The **Ogre** metavariant possesses the standard low-light vison, muscular bulk, enlarged lower canines and pointed aural helix of their primary subspecies. The variation on standard *homo sapiens robustus* come in smoother skin, a protruding jaw, a wider mouth and a stomach similar to the tin-can-eating goats of urban legend. The ogre metavariant stands at a height similar to standard homo sapiens, though the muscular robustness of the species is still present. Ogres seem even closer to their progenitors due to the smoothness of their skin, a trait often lacking in the standard *robustus*, whose skin is often thick and rough. The jawline and wider mouth of the ogre originally spawned urban legends of cannibalism; these rumours were proven false by the ‘40s, but those raised during the era of its prevalence still feel the effects of this misconception. This urban legend was aided by the fact that ogres can digest almost anything they can swallow. The ability to digest so much leads to obesity and even the most athletic ogres can still have a healthy paunch. **(Cost = 60 Karma)**

## **Troll**

**Trolls *(Homo sapiens ingentis)*** make orks look like the ordinary man on the street. Orks might be, on average, less than a quarter-meter taller than humans; troll, by contrast are more than a half-meter taller than orks. Orks might look like a monstrous version of humanity; trolls, on the other hand, look like vaguely human versions of the creature from your most recent nightmare. With thick, curled horns on their heads (some trolls prefer to have them cut, while others polish them with pride), spiky protrusions of calcium on their joints and individual muscles that are larger than a full-grown pig, trolls give the immediate impression that they are built for destruction. Most of them are able to live up to that image. Not all trolls, though, are about absorbing and inflicting damage. They have tried to find their way into different roles, but their large size combines with cultural stereotypes to make it hard for them to fit it. Orks tend to be the most accepting of trolls and the two metatypes often inhabit the same neighbourhoods. Typically, these are not the most resource-rich neighbourhoods in any given sprawl. **(Cost = 80 Karma)**

### **Metavariant subspecies: Minotaur**

**Minotaurs** possess the enhanced muscle mass and thermographic vision of the primary *ingentis* subspecies. Variance occurs in their facial and horn structures, height, body hair and dermal deposit formation. Minotaurs get their name from their wide, flattened nasal structure, wide-set eyes and symmetrical horns, which resemble a bull’s face. Minotaur horns are longer than those of trolls, set at a more forward angle and anchored into thick bone plates that allow the horns to withstand greater impact. They are also nearly four times denser than standard *ingentis* horns. These features allow minotaurs to use their horns in more aggressive ways. Minotaurs also average 10 centimetres shorter than trolls but tend to carry the same bulk with added width, further lending to their bullish appearance. This *ingentis* metavariant usually possesses profuse body hair and a distinct lack of the dermal deposits common to the base subspecies. **(Cost = 90 Karma)**

## **Racial Bonuses**

**Arcane Arrester (2)**: When targeted by a spell (including a critter’s Innate Spell), the character is harder to affect. This potent ability makes casting both benevolent and malevolent spells on these characters much more difficult. The character adds 4 dice to their resistance test against any spell. If the spell is one that is not normally resisted (such as invisibility), the character still rolls their Arcane Arrester dice pool and reduces the hits rolled on the Spellcasting Test by any hits they roll. This quality affects spells they cast on themselves.

**Dermal Armour +1**: You gain a +1 Armour bonus (cumulative with other Armour, without adding Encumbrance).

**Goring Horns**: Use Exotic Melee Weapon (Horns) skill. DV (STR+2)P, Reach-, AP -1.

**Low-Light Vision**: You can see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness though.

**Neoteny**: Halted physical development that leaves them easily mistaken for children or teenagers. Starting Physical Condition Monitor is reduced by 2.

**Pathogen and Toxin Resistance**: Add a +2 dice pool bonus to resist pathogens and toxins.

**Photometabolism**: Forest elves possess some chloroplast skin and grasslike body hair, that supplements their energy needs via photosynthesis. Even when fully exposed to sunlight, this process only creates enough nourishment to supplement a diet, not to replace it. Reduce their Lifestyle costs by ten percent. However, since the character’s overall physical well-being and energy increase in the sunlight, the character feels uncomfortable at night or in the shade, suffering a -1 dice pool penalty on all Social Tests.

**Reach +1**: You have longer reach, giving you an advantage over enemies with lower reach.

**Thermographic Vision**: You can see into the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately and so on.

## **Height and Weight**

Choose the height and weight of your character. The table beneath is a guideline to give you an idea of averages for various metatypes. To get a proportional weight, determine the new height as a percentage of the average height, convert that to a decimal number, cube that figure and then multiply it by the average weight.
