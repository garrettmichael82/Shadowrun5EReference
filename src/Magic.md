# MAGIC

=====================================

### **Force**

Almost everything magical has an attributer known as Force, including spirits, spells, foci and more. This attribute is a measure of magical power of the object or being. Force is often used as a limit for magical effects performed without the channelling benefits of reagents or foci.

### **Drain**

Drain is the price you pay for wielding awesome magical power. The manipulation of mana, whether forming of a spell, brewing a potion or bringing forth a being from another plane, can exhaust of injure you. Mana is a form of energy and channelling greater quantities of that energy can strain the body and mind. This effect is referred to as Drain. Magical actions that cause Drain have a Drain Value, which is a measure of how much Drain they inflict.

Drain generally is inflicted on your as Stun damage, though there are situations in which it can be Physical damage. You resist the damage from Drain through a Drain Resistance Test; each hit reduces the Drain by one. Any remaining Drain is applied as boxes of damage to your Stun (or Physical) Condition Monitor. Drain damage, regardless of whether it is Stun or Physical damage, cannot be healed by any means other than the natural properties of the body – that means no magical healing and no medkits. If you overdo it, you’ll simply need to make time for some rest.

**<a name="_toc218024799"></a>TRADITIONS**\

==========================================
A magical tradition describes how you interact with mana. Sure, you don’t necessarily need things like chants, elegant hand gestures, muttered curses and a holistic philosophy to sling spells and summon spirits but it sure helps you connect to the magic, and your tradition gives you exactly that. Often, when looking for ways to focus, people fall back on elements of their culture or background that they associate with magic. If you spend your whole life thinking that magic happens when you wave a small wand, having such a wand in your hand helps you focus your abilities. Or maybe you’ve been told that magic can be contained in a beaded necklace – in that case, holding and fingering such a necklace is precisely what you need. All magicians are members of one of the magical traditions.

### **Hermetic Mage**

The hermetic mage relies on logic, practice and execution of a planned formula rather than intuition and improvisation to effectively cast spells. They have learned to control magic and believe that the universe (both the magical parts and the mundane) follows patterns of energy that can be manipulated through complex symbols, formulae and arcane knowledge of its components. This tradition was widely practiced (if not effective) even before the Awakening and this form appealed early on to corporations and governments due to its intellectual, formalised nature. In hermetic thinking, casting magic involves imposing the magician’s will on the universe – so you can imagine some of the egos that emerge when mages get together. Mages are scholars and often have libraries of magical information from which they design spells. Any mage worth their reagents has a least a digital copy of one of the founding texts on hermeticism (rich mages have a fancy hard copy written and bound by hand in a very fancy ceremony). Hermetic trappings also include deluxe, well-crafted equipment in archaic laboratories where mages can create preparations and carry out their research. Mages create circles of power (they’re really just magical lodges, just with a hermetic twist, but don’t try to tell a mage that).

Mages, unsurprisingly, take a somewhat arrogant view on conjuring. The mage tends to believe that spirits are intelligent but inferior beings predestined for servitude. With that mindset, mages tend to be more comfortable binding spirits than are spellcasters of other traditions.

### **Shaman**

The shaman uses mana to balance the world of nature and their own will. They believe in harmony and guidance, observing the world and using emotion to weave magic. They respect the gift of magic that connects them to the flow of the spirit of life. To the shaman, the earth is a living being and her children are spirits who guide and aid those that support her; spirits of the sky, mountain, birds, rates, even metahumanity. Shamanis, has been practiced far longer than hermetic magic and can be found in all parts of the world, although it wasn’t taken seriously by modern metahumanity until the Great Ghost Dance. To the shaman, casting a spell is asking a greater universal entity, such as a totem spirit, to grant their power. Shamans call their magical lodges “medicine lodges”. A medicine lodge (also known as a sweat lodge, inipi, kiva, temazcal or a number of other names) can take a variety of forms, including a small domed hit with an animal skin roof or a hole dug into the ground and carefully covered with a ceiling of woven branches or in an urban area, a small room filled with skins, painting and artistically decorative urban junk.

The shamanic perspective on conjuring is based on a belief that spirits are intelligent and ancient, and they should be treated with the respect one would show an elder. Due to their belief that spirits are everywhere, shamans frequently summon spirits from the area when the need arises, rather than binding spirits for long periods. Shamans often develop personal connections to spirits, following them as they learn magic.

### **The Buddhist Tradition**

For Buddhists in the Sixth World, magic springs from personal self-development and spiritual enlightenment. The Buddhist magical tradition mainly stems from one sect of Buddhism – Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism, generally – as the other sects do no teach specific techniques related to sorcery and summoning and instead see magic as another part of reality that must be overcome to find enlightenment (Nirvana). Many magicians who follow the Wuxing or Shinto tradition also consider themselves followers of Buddhism. Buddhists can be called yogis (or yoginis), though this is a general term for practitioners of Southeast Asian religions including Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Traditionalists prefer the term Bodhisattva.

The teachings of Buddhism, common to all Buddhists, include the “four noble truths”: 1) existence is suffering (dukhka); 2) the causes of suffering are craving and attachment (trishna); 3)the end of suffering can be found and is called Nirvana; and 4) the path to Nirvana is the eightfold path: right views, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. Buddhism teaches that reality is most correctly understood as process and relation instead of entity or substance.

The weaving of mana into spells is performed through the proper chanting of mantras and the state of mind that activity creates. The pattern of motion can be included as a way to focus. Some see if as a way of changing reality. Buddhist ritual spellcasting techniques are called mantras. It is a method of mind and body meditation incorporating qi-like channelling of mana energies.

Spirits summoned by a Buddhist are believed to be enlightened divinities that have decided to remain on earth out of compassion for those who still strive to attain Nirvana.

### **Christian Theurgy**

Christianity made its transition to the Sixth World in fits and starts. For some people, it was easy. The supernatural had always played a role in their stories and beliefs, so they simply accepted magic as part of the belief framework they’d always held. Others, however, identified magic with the witchcraft and satanism they’d been warned about for years, so they put up walls (the Catholic Church in particular erecting some strong barriers). The *Imago Dei* encyclical helped break down those walls but it also transitioned people away from the belief that magic was a manifestation of godly power. Christian Theurgists in general see magic as a tool they can use to perform God’s work, rather than a direct channel to the divine. Spirits often make Christian Theurgists uncomfortable – they’re not sure if they should treat them like the souls of the dead, angels, devils or something else, so they’re often more comfortable just leaving them alone.

In its ideal form, Christianity is about helping others and relieving their pain where possible and there are Christian Theurgists who attempt to live up to this ideal. Throughout history, however, there have been all sorts of acts done in the name of Christianity and that remains the case today. Depending on what part of Christian teachings they emphasise or how they choose to interpret them, Christian Theurgists may be involved in a wide variety of activities ranging from the charitable to the reprehensible. But whatever they do, it will have that certain tinge of a holy crusade.

### **Cosmic**

Since the first human (or metahuman, if you like) appeared, the stars have been a source of fascination and wonder. For some mages, simply pondering the heavens was not enough. For these Awakened, the cosmos is the source of life and the most powerful agent in all reality. The harmony of the celestial bodies, their perfect orbits and their predictable nature pleases Cosmic Mages and they aspire for their magic to be similarly perfect and predictable.

Cosmic Mages point to ancient worship of heavenly bodies in Babylon, Egypt and Rome as the basic for their belief, although their forebears tapped into power they didn’t understand. While Cosmic Mages are the first to admit their knowledge is limited as well, they believe that their expanded understanding of the universe and its nature gives them further insight through which to channel their magic.

The fundamental forces behind the universe, the planets, the stars and even dark matter have replaced ancient anthropomorphic symbolism, but honour the sun, moon and stars has resurged, often in corporate settings, as a non-threatening tradition for corporate mages to participate in. Cosmic magic is not idealistic, but skews more deterministic. While Cosmic Mages believe in individual will, they assert that everything happens as a result of the cause-and-effect process begun by the creation of the universe itself.

Cosmic Mages exclusively follow the Sun, Moon or Star mentor spirits (though some whisper about a Black Hole mentor spirit).

Beyond recognising the universe as the ultimate source of power, Cosmic Mages have few unchallenged ideals. They value science and exploration and have little patience for other traditions, which they consider fairy tales.

### **Druid**

The umbrella term “druid” encompasses a variety of beliefs, from the nature-centred perspective of the Celtic druids to the heavily shamanic viewpoint of wild druids to the esoteric mumblings of English druids. The commonality between the beliefs in the invocation of spirits tied to particular locations and the desire of the druid to work with those spirits to gain a measure of control over what happens in that spot. The Celtic druid may believe in a spirit that predates the existence of humanity, while English druids believe the spirits were shaped by the places and by the humans living there but in operative terms that is a minor distinction – both believe the spirit is important and both want the spirit on their side.

While druids have a great respect for the land, that attitude often is limited to their piece of land. They can be very territorial, working hard to protect their chosen lands while unleashing fury on spots they believe may be a threat to them. They are highly conscious of background counts, mana ebbs, ley lines and other astral phenomena, since they know how those elements can affect the defence of their territory. Many of them are quite proactive in aspecting the mana of their favoured area toward their tradition, giving them a very useful advantage.

### **Hinduism**

The Hindu tradition is based on the Hindu religious system and it is designed to provide a path for the enlightened to reach transcendence. The path is one of ritual devotion, asceticism and karmic purity. While the exact strictures followed by each school vary, most accept the precepts from the *Vedas*, texts originally written in Ancient India. Those followers who are Awakened believe following the precepts of their faith assist them along the path.

The Hindi believes the soul is in a constant cycle of death and rebirth, governed by a relationship with karma. Those who follow their particular school of thought (*dasarnas*) and caste’s rules are reincarnated into a higher caste, eventually reaching *moksha* or transcendence. Those who refuse to follow their destined path are reincarnated as a lesser being.

The Awakened members of the Hindu faith who follow this tradition generally fall into two categories. The *Brahmin*, members of the high caste, use magic in a priestly manner and are usually magicians or aspected magicians. The *saddhu* practices the path of the ascetic, using yogic practices to reach their ultimate goal, primarily supported by adepts and mystic adepts. The summoning of spirits largely takes the form of calling on *devas*, roughly benevolent entities, while others call on the *asuras*, entities with less obvious motivations.

The practitioners of this tradition frequently use *bhajans* (devotional songs), mantras and yoga in their spellcasting of power usage. Magic and dance are normally major components of rituals, helping the caster focus their concentration and mana. Sanskrit is also frequently used.

### **Norse**

Norse magicians believe that Old Gods once again watch over Midgard. Asatru, the old faith of the Norse, has seen a popular comeback and with it the revival of its visceral and pagan magic. Both Awakened and mundane Asatru gather for great ceremonies known as blots and sumbles. These are traditionally held on Midsummer’s or Midwinter’s Day and the spring or autumn equinoxes. Common elements of these rituals include liberal drinking and the sacrifice of a game animal for consumption (for urban Asatru practitioners, real meat sausages can be used).

Norse mages typically have individual members of the Norse pantheon as mentor spirits. Odin may be represented in a way similar to the Wise Warrior totem, Thor has similarities to Dragonslayer and Loki, of course, has much in common with the trickster totems such as Coyote and Raven. Berserkers often claim particular animal totems such as Bear.

While possibly disappointing to those who wish to pillage and plunder as part of their belief system, the Norse paradigm is much more complex than simple berserkers and warriors. Courage, truth, honour, fidelity, discipline, hospitality, industriousness, self-reliance and perseverance are their core value. While each individual values these in various amounts, the Norse tradition finds common purpose with many of the Sixth World’s current values. The trope of the noble barbarian surely exists for some, but for others, it is the ancient family- and honour-based system that fits best with them.

### **Phytomancy**

One the surface, Phytomancy (or Green Magic) seems to have much in common with eco-shamanism or nature-based Druidic traditions. But dig a little deeper and, common interests aside, they are startlingly different. Phytomancers view their magic as coming from an elemental power beyond our world that connects all plant life together in one metaplanar ecosystem. They don’t necessarily focus on balance and harmony with nature or honouring all spirits equally. Rather, they give primacy to plant life and only pursue goals that aim to increase the growth and spread of plant life. In return, the Phytomancers gain tremendous power in the domain of plants.

Phytomancers hold respect for plant life above everything else. In their mind, life on Earth and everywhere else in the universe, not only started with plant life but is sustained by it. The idea that metahumanity, animal life in general or any other sapient life holds more value than the world’s plant life is abhorrent to them. As long as the Green survives, the rest of life will find a way also.

### **Shinto**

The official religion of Japan, Shinto has spread with the power of Imperial Japan and the corporations that originated there. Shinto features a number of public shrines devoted to the *kami* or gods. Its tenets are largely based around harmony with *kami* spirits, with Awakened activities being considered a natural extension of this concept and it lacks dogmatic approach to its worship. The religion currently has 115,000 shrines and over 25,000 priests in Japan, with more around the world. The Emperor has increased the influence of the religion in national politics by including practitioners as part of the national rebuilding effort.

Shinto is one of the few shamanic traditions accepted into the ranks of the corporations, largely as many executives are immersed in aspects of the religious beliefs from a young age and do not find its practitioners too rebellious. Unlike, Amerindian traditions, most *kannushi* do not have a single mentor but attempt to live harmoniously with all the *kami*. Key portions of this harmony are respect for nature and ensuring physical and spiritual cleanliness through proper ritual. Honouring the *kami* is important to the Awakened, as they regularly ask favours of the spirits, especially looking for assistance in the use of magic.

Shinto magic techniques are closely tied to the religion whose name they share. Protective charms, normally called *ofuda* are used to anchor wards within a building, normally placed within the home’s *kamidana* or household altar. Personal protection amulets, called *omamori*, are frequently used to ward off bad luck or to encourage success in different endeavours; for the Awakened they are commonly made into foci for Counterspelling or Banishing. Other protective charms are also used by believers to bring good fortune, fight against bad luck or induce and bless child birth.

### **Sioux**

Perhaps the most important thing to understand about beliefs in the Sioux tradition is the term Wakan Tanka. By most interpretations it means “Great Spirit”, meaning the power of life that animates everything in this world, from the sun to the earth to the plants and animals that live on it. Wakan Tanka has been described as a sheltering tree covering all the children of the one mother and one father.

But there is also an interpretation of Wakan Tanka that makes it to mean “Great Mystery”. This serves as a reminder that the power that animates the world is not something mere humans understand and that we should accept it in its mystery rather than trying to impose human understanding on it. Living with this incomprehensibility is part of life and the sooner one can accommodate oneself to it, the sooner you can be more in harmony with the world and nature instead of living in conflict.

Don’t let this goal of peace fool you into thinking that everything about the Sioux tradition is sweetness and light. Sioux mythology is full of a vast range of characters. Iktomi the spider and Coyote are always around to cause trouble, Unktehi the serpent makes trouble for Thunderbird and Double Face preys on humanity. The Great Spirit may be incomprehensible but the trouble these other beings can cause is only too plain and practitioners of the Sioux tradition are well aware of what they need to look out for. Or, if they are of a more mischievous frame of mind, who to emulate.

Rather than study formulae or ancient tomes, practitioners of the Sioux tradition try to take clues and hints from how to best do magic from the world around them. The world is full of information to those who take the time to observe it and Sioux Awakened are usually willing to take that time. They observe carefully, letting the auras and beings around them speak, doing their best to hear the stories they are telling rather than impose their own meaning upon them. Once they have that information, though, they are swift and sure – and devastating, if they need to be.

### **Wicca**

The Wiccan tradition is the Awakened manifestation of one of the Sixth World’s largest recognisable neo-pagan movements. Wicca is a collection of beliefs, tenets gathered from nineteenth century sources and New Age reasoning merged with earlier, pre-Christian concepts. The central tenets of the religion are harmony with nature and the Wiccan Rede or a similar code.

All Wiccan magicians who summon a spirit show deference and normally make a small payment of some kind, as the *Law of Threefold Return* is a constant theme in the tradition’s teachings.

Wiccan followers are not part of a monolithic entity but are composed of several different sects of lineages, sometimes called *traditions*.

**<a name="_toc218024800"></a>THE ASTRAL**\

==========================================

### **Astral Signature**

Generally, when magicians cast a spell or perform a ritual, they leave their astral fingerprints on it. This is called an **astral signature** and it’s produced on anything affected by magic skills or abilities. This astral signature can be detected by anyone with the Assensing skill. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to the magical effect’s Force after the effect (spell, critter power, astral battle or whatever it was) ends, slowly fading into the background. An astral signature of a spell can be detected both where it was cast and where it took effect. Semi-permanent objects such as alchemical preparations and watchers contain an astral signature while they last. More permanent items such as foci, lodges and magic circles always contain the astral signature of the owner.

A character can attempt to read an astral signature when an Assensing + Intuition [Astral] Test. This is not the simplest task, as perceiving the understanding an astral signature is somewhat difficult amid the mixture of magic and emotional background of the astral plane. Once successfully read, a signature can be recognised again (possibly with a Memory Test). Other details such as the general class of spell or spirit or the skill of the magician can be determined with net hits (similar to Assensing an aura).

A magician using astral perception can “wipe clean” a temporary astral signature (such as from sorcery) or hasten its normal fading. A magician can spend a Complex Action to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signature to fade by 1 hour (mentally pushing the signature into the background energy, if you will). No test is required. This action can be done multiple times until the astral signature is gone. If the signature is not completely erased, it will be obvious to other assensing it that someone tampered with it.

### **Astral Tracking**

Nearly all magical things (spirits, spells, foci and magical lodges) have an astral link to whoever was responsible for them. Active spells are linked to their casters, spirits are linked to their summoners, astrally projecting magicians are linked to their physical bodies and foci and magical lodges are linked to the magicians who activated them. Awakened entities who assense the astral signature of these astral forms can track their links through the astral plane back to their sources. Following an astral link requires an Assensing + Intuition (5, 1 hour) [Astral] Extended Test modified by Astral Tracking Modifiers.

**<a name="_toc218024801"></a>ASTRAL PERCEPTION**\

=================================================
Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called **astral perception**. It is a primary sense used in the astral plane that allows you to “see” auras and other things in the astral world overlaid on the material plane. Technically, astral perception isn’t vision – you don’t need working eyes to see in the astral plane – but vision is the easiest metaphor to use.

With the skill of Assensing, you can interpret the “colours” and “brightness” of an aura to determine the wellness and state of being of the subject. When astrally perceiving, you become **dual-natured** (meaning you have presence in both the physical and astral planes simultaneously) and can interact with astral objects, including through combat. Astrally perceiving while trying to accomplish mundane tasks is very distracting; you take a -2 dice pool penalty to actions on the physical plane.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what you’re looking at takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to which they belong is called Assensing. If you want to learn more about an aura, you may make a Simple Assensing + Intuition [Astral] Test, with the number of hits determining how much you learn. Without attempting to read an aura, you can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, ritual, spirit, living creature, foreboding horror from beyond all mortal ken, etc.).

Like physical perception, you don’t need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easy to spot). You only need to roll the dice when your target is trying to hide or when you’re trying to observe in detail – then you make an Assensing Test to see what you can see.

Objects that are neither magical nor living do not have an aura; they are featureless grey shadows of their physical form. They can, however, pick up impressions for a limited time from being in contact with living auras. A teddy bear in the Barrens might pick up a child’s fear, a wedding ring its owner’s sense of love and joy or a murder weapon an aura of rage. These impressions are vague and fleeting, but you don’t need to assense the object to get them.

**<a name="_toc218024802"></a>ASTRAL PROJECTION**\

=================================================
If astral perception is like sticking your face in a lake to peer below the surface, astral projection is diving right in. Your consciousness is contained in an astral form and can leave your corporeal body. Your astral form is a mental projection of your self-image combined with physical characteristics based on your mental attributes, which means you can always have awesome hair.

A projecting mage can travel around the astral plane at great speeds unimpeded by material objects such as walls, floors and burly goons (unless they are dual-natured). Your body is in a coma-like state while your astral body is out in the aether. Your mind and body are still connected, so any damage taken to body or mind is felt by both. Only characters who are full Magicians can astrally project.

You’re using astral perception the entire time you’re projecting, so you can see the auras of living things. Auras alone don’t give you the mystic link you need to target spells. As the saying goes, what’s cast in astral space stays in astral space, and ditto for physical space.

### **Astral Attributes**

|**Physical Attribute**|**Astral Attribute**|
| :- | :- |
|**Agility**|Logic|
|**Body**|Willpower|
|**Reaction**|Intuition|
|**Strength**|Charisma|
|***Astral Initiative***|Intuition x2|
|***Initiative Dice***|+2D6 (3D6 total)|

### **Inherent Limit: Astral**

If you’re going to go messing about in astral space, you need a strong mind, because that’s what’s going to be doing all your heavy lifting once you leave your body behind. Your mind is both your best muscle and your basic limiter in the astral. Your Astral limit is equal to your Mental or Social limit, whichever is greater.

### **Astral Movement**

Astral forms can move almost at the speed of thought. The magician only needs to visualise themselves at a place and their astral body travels there. Any nearby places can be reached in seconds, minutes for locations on the same continent, hours to get anywhere on the globe. At this speed however, you have no time to perceive the environment and things you pass are a blur (think warp speed in movies). **Astral barriers** block astral travel and you might run into one before you realise that it’s in your way.

If you’re looking for a particular place or thing, you must travel at a slower pace. “Slower” in this case means up to 100 metres each Combat turn – this is considered to be the Walking rate in astral space. Moving faster, 5 kilometres per Combat Turn, is your Running rate – the normal penalties to actions for Running apply in these cases.

Astral forms can move in any direction – they are not limited by gravity as they are in the physical world, though most projecting magicians tend to stick close to the ground because that’s where most of the interesting stuff is, if not out of force of habit. The exception to this freedom of movement is at the limits of the Earthly atmosphere (about eighty kilometres up) – the Gaiasphere weakens to the point where astral voyagers usually go mad or die.

Only astral forms can slow or affect another astral form. The Earth is solid on the astral plane, just as it is in the physical world; astral forms cannot pass through it. Secure facilities are often built underground to keep out astral intruders. Active weapon foci have a presence in astral space and can harm an astral form but you must be present on the astral plane to use the focus in astral combat. Only mana spells affect astral forms.

### **Manifesting**

A purely astral form such as a spirit or an astrally projecting magician can interact with the physical plane by manifesting. Manifesting is a psychic effect that lets you make yourself visible and audible on the physical plane through an act of will. Manifesting makes a Complex Action to engage or disengage. You appear on the physical plane as a ghostly, hazy image of your astral form and may freely communicate with physical characters. Unlike the Materialisation power of spirits, manifesting doesn’t give you a physical form, so you can’t interact with anything physically (or be harmed by physical attacks). It’s a psychic connection, so you can’t cast spells on targets on the physical plane while you’re manifesting. For the same reason, technological devices can’t detect or record you. You’re still on the astral plane, so astral attacks can still target you. Manifesting is pretty taxing, so you can only manifest for a total of your Magic rating x 5 minutes per astral projection session.

### **Staying Astral**

It’s mentally taxing to stay on the astral plane for a long time. You can use astral projection for a number of hours equal to your Magic Rating x 2. If you stay out longer, your astral being ceases to exist and your body dies. If you return to your body, this clock stops, but it doesn’t reset until you’ve spent at least as long in your body as you spent out of it.

### **Astral Detection**

Physical beings may sense when an astral form passes through their aura. Make a Perception + Intuition (4) [Mental] Test – you receive a +2 dice pool bonus if you’re Awakened. If the test is successful, the character feels slightly breathless and experiences a chill or tingling sensation from the passing of the astral form. Some security personnel are trained to recognise this feeling as a sign of an astral intruder. This specialisation of Perception is called Numinous Perception, which includes both the chilly tingle of astral forms and the “vibes” of noticing magic.

### **Astral Combat**

Astral combat is resolved in a similar way to physical combat. Astrally perceiving and dual-natured character use their physical attributes and skills fight opponents with a physical body and their Astral Combat + Willpower to fight wholly astral entities. Astrally projecting characters use their mental attributes in place of physical ones along with the Astral Combat skill. There are no ranged weapons that function in astral space, so unarmed attacks, active weapon foci and mana spells are the only options for astral combat.

Unarmed astral attacks are performed through an Opposed Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral] v Intuition + Logic Test. Astral attacks with a weapon focus are an Opposed Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral] v Intuition + Logic Test. The Base Damage Value for Magicians is their Charisma; for a Weapon Focus, the weapon damage; for a spirit, the spirit’s Force and for a Watcher, 1. Add 1 to the DV per net hit on an attack. Damage inflicted from astral combat can be either Stun or Physical (attacker’s choice). Astral barriers can only be affected by Physical damage.

### **Mana Barriers**

Mana barriers are magical walls that impede or block magic and astral forms. Mana barrier can be on the physical or astral planes, but some are dual-natured barriers that exist on both.

Mana barriers on the physical plane are invisible (except to astral perception), but they act as solid barriers to spells, manifesting entities, spirits and active foci. Anybody trying to cast a spell through a barrier must contend with the Force of the barrier, which is added to the Defence or the Resistance dice pool. If the spell doesn’t normally have an opposed dice pool, the Spellcasting test becomes an Opposed Test against the Force of the barrier.

Mana barriers on the astral plant are solid, hazily opaque walls. Such barriers stop astral movement and impose a visual penalty equal to the barrier’s Force. Astral mana barriers are resistant to astral spells as well as other astral forms, in the same manner as physical mana barriers.

Dual-natured mana barriers are active on both planes simultaneously and they act like mana barriers on both planes at once.

Adept power and many always-on critter powers are innate and so are unaffected by a barrier. Certain ranged and sustained critter powers suffer the same fate as spells.

Mana barriers do not affect their creators, who can see through them or pass through them at will and allow others to do so as well.

### **Getting Around Mana Barriers**

If you’ve got a mana barrier in your way, you’ve got a couple of options other than “give up”. You can try breaking through violently or you can try passing through subtly.

If you want to break through a mana barrier, you need to deal with its Armour and Structure Ratings, just as you would with any other barrier. A mana barrier has Armour and Structure Ratings equal to its Force. Break it quickly, because they regain their full Structure at the end of every Combat Turn. The creator of a mana barrier is instantly aware of any attack on the barrier.

Alternatively, you can slide through a barrier with Magic + Charisma [Astral] v barrier’s Force x 2 Opposed Test. If you get any net hits, you pass through the barrier and emerge on the other side. You can bring a number of friends, spirits, active foci, sustained spells or other astral forms with you – one for each additional net hit you score. If the barrier scores more hits, you fail to break through.

### **Astral Intersections**

Mana barriers and astral forms are often tied to physical objects. Astral beings can’t push physical objects around, so objects may get dragged into contact with barriers or (rarely) other astral constructs.

If this happens, each astral form makes an Opposed Test: living beings a Magic + Charisma and non-living barriers and objects a Force x 2 Test. The participant with any net hits remains normal and intact, while all others are disrupted – on a tie, all participants are disrupted.

Disruption means different consequences for different things. Disrupted spells and rituals end, disrupted preparations lose their spell and becomes mundane, disrupted mana barriers collapse, disrupted foci deactivate, disrupted spirits are banished and disrupted living creatures are knocked unconscious with a full Stun Condition Monitor. Any permanent mana barrier that is disrupted regains all its Structure at the end of the Combat Turn.

======================================
In the small segment of the world that has Awakened to magic power, there is an even smaller segment who are able to channel the mana into themselves, giving them enhanced physical abilities that make them more than meta-human. They are the physical adepts – or, for those who like fewer words, just adepts – and they are known for their very disciplined self-improvement. They include athletes, martial artists, religious acolyte, exercise gurus and others who seek to combine mind and body. Adepts are concerned with the harmony of body and mind and the strengthening of both and they focus their magical power towards those ends.

In the early days of the Sixth World, when the world saw the rise of people who could use magic to increase their own physical and mental potential, adepts didn’t face the same prejudice as magicians and shamans. Instead, they found themselves facing a mythos generated by corporate trids extolling their magical athleticism. This put adepts up on a pedestal – people either wanted to try to fight them to gain rep or to worship them, thinking that perhaps that would be the path to getting some abilities for themselves.

### **Using Powers**

As an adept, you get Power Points equal to your Magic Rating at character creation. You then spend the Power Points on buying adept powers. The maximum number of levels you can have of any one power is equal to your Magic Rating or up to the limit listed by the power, whichever is less.

Some powers are activated and some are intrinsic. Adept powers that need to be activated before they have any effect have an activation cost listed in the power’s description (usually an action of some sort). When a power doesn’t list an activation cost, their effect is intrinsic – you don’t have to take any action to gain the benefit of the power.

**Adept Drain**: Some powers cause Drain. The Drain from adept power is Stun unless specified in the description and is resisted with Body + Willpower.

### **Adept Powers**

**Adrenaline Boost**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

This power lets you accomplish more in one Combat Turn. You get +2 to your Initiative Score for the current Combat Turn for every level of this power you have. At the beginning of the next turn after the Adrenaline Boost, you take 2  Drain.

**Animal Empathy**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power gives the adept a greater affinity for all non-sentient animals, both normal and paranormal. For every level, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus to all Animal Handling Tests. This power can also be used to intimidate or frighten animals.

**Astral Perception**

|Cost: 1 pp|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- |

This power allows you to bridge the gap between the physical and astral realms and see into the astral plane. Since you’re dual-natured while you’re using astral perception, you can attack astral forms when you use this power.

**Attribute Boost**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- |

You call upon inner strength to perform amazing physical feats beyond their normal abilities. Attribute Boost must be purchases for a specific Physical Attribute (Agility, Body, Reaction or Strength); separate Attribute Boost power may be bought for different attributes. This power cannot be purchased for a Mental or Special Attribute.

When you activate this power, make a Magic + Attribute Boost Rating Test. Each hit on this test boosts your attribute rating by 1, up to your augmented Attribute maximum. This only affects your dice pools; your Physical limit and Initiative ratings don’t change with Attribute Boost. The boost lasts for a number of Combat Turns equal to twice the number of hits you get. When the boost runs out, you take Drain equal to the level of this power.

**Authoritative tone**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level (Max 3)|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Adepts with this power can speak in a way that makes people want to believe them and follow their orders. For every level of this power, an adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus to any Opposed Social Skill Test that they initiate.

**Blind Fighting**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Drawing on a special kind of sixth sense, an adept with this power is able to continue fighting even when blinded or deprived of vision. If reduces the penalty for impaired vision by one per level of this power.

**Cloak**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Using the Cloak power, the adept has an increased chance of avoiding magical detection. For every level of this power, the adept gains a +1 die for opposing a Detection spell being used against them. Cloak does not prevent the reading of the adept’s aura through astral perception or viewing from astral space; it just makes it more difficult to zero in on the targeted adept.

**Combat Sense**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Combat Sense provides an instinctive sense of any potential threats nearby. In defending against ranged and melee attacks, you gain a +1 dice pool bonus to defence tests per level of this power. Adepts with this power are always allowed a Perception Test before a possible surprise situation, gaining the benefit of being alerted if the test is successful.

**Critical Strike (Skill)**

|Cost: 0.5 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power improves a specific melee skill: either Unarmed Combat, Clubs, Blades, Astral Combat or a particular Exotic Melee Weapon skill. The specific skill is chosen when you buy the power. Increase the DV of your attacks with the selected skill by 1. Critical Strike is compatible with weapons and other adept powers. This power may be selected multiple times, each time for a different melee skill.

**Danger Sense**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You are instinctively sensitive of your surroundings and of impending threats that may not be immediately visible. It’s the bad feeling that the character gets before walking into a trap, the gut instinct that makes them jump an instant before trouble hits. For each level of this power, you get a +1 dice pool bonus on Surprise Tests.

**Empathic Healing**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

The Empathic Healing power allows an adept to literally take on the wounds of another in order to heal them. To accomplish this, the adept rolls a Magic + Willpower Test. For every hit, up to one box of Physical damage transfers from the wounded target to the adept’s Condition Monitor. Only Physical damage can be healed in this way.

Subjects with lower than normal Essence, due to augmentations or Essence loss, are more difficult to heal. Apply a negative modifier of the same amount that would be applied to healing. The transfer of wounds requires two full Combat Turns per box of damage to complete and the healing adept must maintain physical contact during the entire process. Damage modifiers are applied once the adept completes the process.

**Enhanced Accuracy (Skill)**

|Cost: 0.25 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

A weapon in your hands becomes an extension of your body. When you buy this power, choose a Combat Skill (Pistols, Clubs, Heavy Weapons, etc.). When you use the skill, add 1 to the Accuracy of the weapon you’re using. This power cannot be used with Unarmed Combat, but it can be purchased multiple times with a different skill each time.

**Enhanced Perception**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power sharpens all your senses. Add a +1 dice pool bonus per level to all Perception Tests and Assensing Tests.

**Freefall**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power helps adepts absorb the damage from a fall or jump down for a specific distance. Every level of Freefall allows the adept to fall or jump down 3 additional metres without any adverse effects (beyond the three metres normally allowed). When calculating fall damage past their personal distance threshold, subtract the overall bonus from the fall and then apply damage normally. This means that an adept with a single level in Freefall receives no damage from a fall or six metres of less, rather than the typical three metres. As long as the adept takes no damage from the fall, the fall counts as a normal Move Action and can be combined with an attack. Longer falls count as a Complex Action. This ability does not help the adept increase the distance they are jumping.

**Improved Ability (Skill)**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power increases the Rating of a specific Combat, Physical, Social, Technical or Vehicle skill per level of the power. You need to know the skill in order to buy this power for it and you can’t but it for skill groups. The maximum improvement possible is your current skill level x 1.5 (rounded up).

**Improved Physical Attribute (Physical Attribute)**

|Cost: 1 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows you to increase a physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reaction and Strength). This augments your attribute, so your Physical limit may also increase with the new Attribute rating. This power allows you to exceed your natural Attribute maximum, up to your augmented maximum.

**Improved Potential (Limit)**

|Cost: 0.5 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows an adept to raise one of your inherent limits (Physical, Mental or Social), specified when you but the power, by 1. You may buy this power multiple times, once per inherent limit.

**Improved Reflexes**

|Cost: 1.5 pp (Level 1)|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |
|Cost: 2.5 pp (Level 2)||
|Cost: 3.5 pp (Level 3)||
This power increases the speed at which you react. For each level, you receive a +1 to Reaction (which also affects Initiative) and +1D6 Initiative Die (to a maximum of 5D6). The maximum rating of Improved Reflexes is 3 and the increase cannot be combined with other technological or magical increases to Initiative.

**Improved Sense**

|Cost: 0.25 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power gives you sensory improvements not normally possessed by your character’s metatype. These improvements may include low-light or thermographic vision, high or low frequency hearing and so on. Any sense enhancement provided by cyberware or bioware can be provided by this power, unless that either gives you bonus dice to Perception Tests or needs wireless to work (or both).

In addition to the sensory enhancements listed for cyberware and bioware, other improvements that can be selected include:

*Direction Sense*: Add a +2 dice pool bonus to Navigational skill tests when traveling. In addition, with a Perception + Intuition (2) Test, you can identify the direction you’re facing and if you’re above or below the mean sea level.

*Improved Tactile*: The adept’s fingers are sensitive to imperfections on the surface of an object, allowing you to notice something as subtle as the indentation of writing on a piece of paper (even paper on a pad beneath the sheet that was actually written on). Add a +2 dice pool bonus to tactile Perception Tests.

*Perfect Pitch*: With a Perception + Intuition (2) Test, you can recognise a musical tone either from hearing it or even feeling the vibration frequency. This doesn’t mean that you’re a good singer, just that you can recognise when you’re off key.

**Iron Will**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power makes the adept more resistant to external influences. The character may add the power’s level as a dice pool modifier in tests to resist mental manipulation or mind control, whether originating from spells, adepts powers or spirit powers.

**Killing Hands**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

This power lets you inflict lethal damage with your unarmed attacks. When inflicting damage on the target of an unarmed attack, you may choose whether to cause Stun or Physical damage. Killing hands may be combined with other adept powers that increase unarmed damage. Your Killing Hands attacks are magical, so they can bypass a creature’s magical defences against attack, such as the Immunity to Normal Weapons power and may be used by adepts with Astral Perception during astral combat.

**Kinesics**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Kinesics grants you complete control over your body’s nonverbal and subconscious communication and social cues, even when you’re in stressful social situation. It includes facial expressions, body movements, eye movements, fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure and even control over sweat glands, making it difficult to gauge your emotional state and truthfulness. Add +1 die per level to resist Social Tests and tests to read your emotions like Judge Intentions, assensing or truthfulness tests.

**Light Body**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Light Body is used to make incredible jumps over long distances. Add the power’s level to your Agility before calculating maximum distance you can jump. Also, add 1 die per level to your Acrobatics Test when you make your jump. If you fall, reduce the effective distance of a fall by the level in meters when calculating your falling damage.

**Metabolic Control**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

An adept with this power has the ability to enter a deep meditative state where all metabolic processes are slowed. This has two benefits. This first is to reduce the amount of rest the adept needs. In game terms, for every hour the adept is in this state, they increase the interval for taking fatigue damage from sleep deprivation by another three hours. The second benefit preserves the adept’s life in emergency situations. When the adept goes into Physical overflow damage, they immediately go into this meditative state. While in this state, the adept only takes an additional box of overflow damage every (Body) hours. An adept can exit this state whenever they wish, but doing so while severely injured causes all wounds or toxins to immediately take effect unless treated or healed.

**Missile Parry**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Activation: Interrupt Action|
| :- | :- |

You can catch slow-moving projectiles such as arrows, thrown knives, grenades or shuriken out of the air. This is an Interrupt Action and reduces you Initiative Score by 5. When using this power, add +1 die per level to your defence pool against the attacker’s ranged attack test. If you generate net hits, you pluck the missile out of the air. You need to have at least one empty hand to use Missile Parry.

**Mystic Armour**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power protects you from physical attacks. For every level, this power gives you 1 point of Armour (cumulative with other armour) that also protects against damage you take in astral combat.

**Natural Immunity**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Add +1 die per level to your tests to resist toxins and disease.

**Pain Resistance**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Pain resistance allows you to ignore the effects of injury (but not the actual damage). For every level of pain resistance, the wound modifiers on the Condition Monitor move one box farther down the chart, so that with 1 level of this power, you take the -1 penalty after 4 boxes of damage instead of 3. If you have 2 levels of the power, the penalty doesn’t kick in until you have 5 boxes of damage. Pain resistance works equally on the Physical and Stun Condition Monitors. Pain resistance also allows you to resist pain from torture, magic, illness, etc. Each level adds a +2 dice pool bonus to any test you make to withstand suffering.

**Poison Cloud**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

This power surrounds the adept in a dense cloud of airborne toxin. All ranged attacks made while the power is active (either against or by the adept) are considered to be in Moderate Fog/Smoke. If anyone makes a successful melee attack against an adept with this power active, the attack must resist the damage effects of the poison (DV equal to the Magic attribute of the adept with the inhalation vector and an immediate onset). Otherwise, if another character is within very close range they are similarly affected. If the damage from the poison cloud is not completely resisted, the victim enters anaphylactic shock, resulting in muscle spasms and autonomic system failure if left untreated. The victim continues to take 1 box of unresisted Physical damage each Combat Turn until death or until the victim is treated as per Stabilisation.

**Poison Strike**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Prerequisite: Killing Hands|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- | :- |

Adepts with this power can channel poison into an Unarmed Combat attack to cause a poison affliction (DV equal to the Magic attribute of the adept with the contact vector and an immediate onset) in addition to the normal damage of the strike. A Simple Action is required to first channel the poison. The poison will infuse attacks for Combat Turns equal to the adept’s Magic attribute, until the adept deactivates it with a Bonus Action or is rendered unconscious.

**Rapid Healing**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You recover from damage more quickly, magically healing yourself over periods of time. Add +1 die per level to your Healing Tests. Also add +1 die per level to any tests made to heal you through magical or mundane means (such as a Heal spell or the First Aid skill), whether the attempt is made by you or another character.

**Spell Resistance**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You are inherently resistant to spells. Add +1 die per level to Resistance Tests against spells, spell rituals, alchemical preparations or Innate Spell critter power (but not other critter powers). Spell Resistance does not interfere with spells that you choose not to resist.

**Spirit Claw**

|Cost: 0.25 pp|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

Spirit Claw allows the adept to temporarily create a small weapon of spiritual energy for use against spirits. Adepts have learned to form weapons based on their particular Way or paradigm – clubs, hammers, daggers, spikes and so on. Spirit Claw add (Magic x 0.5) to the adept’s unarmed DV against spirits (regardless of whether the combat is physical or astral). It remains active for (Magic x 0.5) Combat Turns or when the adept deactivates it with a Bonus Action or successfully strikes with it. To use Spirit Claw again, the energies must be re-channelled by spending another Bonus Action. Against spirits, this power can only be combined with the Killing Hands power.

**Stillness**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows an adept to exert control over their body to avoid detection. By slowing their physiological processes (heart rate, breathing and the need to flex muscles) and entering a relaxed state, the adept becomes completely motionless for a specific amount of time. Their body’s heat signature is also lessened, making the adept harder to detect by thermographic means. For every level of this power, the adept can remain in this state for approximately one hour. Anyone using auditory or thermographic means to locate or perceive an adept using this power receives a negative penalty equal to the level of the adept’s power. Visual searches or Perception Tests are unaffected by this power. This power is negated as soon as the adept moves. An adept may have a maximum of 3 levels in this power.

**Temperature Tolerance**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows adepts to better withstand the effects of extreme temperatures. For every level in this power, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus for resisting damage caused by extreme temperature exposure. This can also be used against magical effects such as elemental fire or cold.

**Traceless Walk**

|Cost: 1 pp|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You can move over surfaces – even snow, sand or thin paper – without leaving visible traces. You make no noise through contact with the floor (though movement may still cause other sounds) and any hearing-based Perception Tests to detect you suffer a -4 dice pool penalty. You don’t trip ground-vibration or pressure sensors. You can’t walk across liquid surfaces – you’re magical, not miraculous – but you can walk across deep snow without sinking. While you can be tracked by non-visual cues such as scent, even those Track Tests are more difficult and get a -2 dice pool penalty.

**Voice Control**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You get an amazing level of control over the properties of your voice. You can change your voice’s pitch, modulation and tone at will, as well as increase your volume. You can mask your voice and imitate souths within the normal range of metahuman vocalisation (no infrasound or ultrasound) and mimic the voices of others. If you use this trick to fool a person or a voice recognition system, make an Opposed Test using your Impersonation + Charisma [Mental] against the voice recognition system’s Rating x2 or against the Perception + Intuition of characters the adept is attempting to fool, adding the level of this power as a bonus to your dice pool.

You can also adjust your voice to generate positive social effects, giving you +1 per level to your Social limit.

**Wall Running**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- |

You can run up sheer walls or other vertical surfaces a limited distance. Make a Running + Strength [Magic] Test, with hits indicating the number of meters you may climb up in an action phase. If you want to run up longer distances, you’ll need steps, ledges or somewhere you can stop and then use this power again. If you want to run across a vertical surface instead of up it, you can do so by combining this power with a Sprint action. At the end of the movement, you fall off the wall, whether you made it as far as you wanted or not.

**<a name="_toc218024804"></a>CONJURING**\

=========================================
Conjuring is the art of calling, dismissing and controlling independent astral beings called **spirits**. Conjuring can compel a spirit to come to the magician and provide services or favours with Summoning, press a spirit into lasting service with Binding or dismiss or destroy a spirit with Banishing.

**Spirit Basics**: Spirits are naturally astral forms, much like you’re naturally a physical form. A spirit exists entirely in astral space, with astral attributes based on their Force. A spirit can manifest, use astral travel and get blocked by mana barriers, just like any other astral form. Its appearance strongly reflects its type and the tradition of the magician who summoned it. A hermetic fire spirit might look like a traditional fire elemental, while a shaman’s spirit of air might appear as an eagle or a butterfly.

If a spirit wants to affect anything on the physical plane, it has to materialise first. It gets physical attributes based on its type and appears as a solid, physical version of its astral form – it’s relatively solid even if it doesn’t look solid, like a spirit whirlwind or a water elemental. The spirit is dual-natured while it’s materialised, which means it exists simultaneously on the physical and astral plane, meaning it can see objects in both places – and be targeted by both mages on the physical plane and astral entities, such as astrally projecting mages. When materialised, the spirit is able to perceive the physical world much as other material beings do. A spirit’s physical form is metahuman-sized or smaller and very obviously ethereal (there is no mistaking a spirit for something worldly). Its physical body is not subject to gravity – though most spirits stay close to the ground because that’s where all the action is – but it can be knocked around by other forces (which makes staying grounded handy at times).

Spirits follow the normal rules for combat, whether physical or astral. If all of the boxes on a spirit’s Condition Monitor (either of them) are filled, the spirit is painfully disrupted and is forced back to its home metaplane. Any services it still owes are lost.

**Spirit-Summoner Link**: A spirit doesn’t have to speak to their summoner out loud. It can communicate telepathically with the summoner, even from astral space, so it doesn’t even have to manifest to receive order or make reports. This link allows for communication over a distance but does not extend to the metaplanes, nor does it allow any other visual or audio connection. With this link, a summoner knows when a spirit they have summoned has been disrupted, as they will feel the loss of the link.

**Spirit Range**: Your spirit can’t move farther away from you than your Magic rating x 100 metres. If forced out of this range, the spirit will try to return as quickly as possible. If you send a spirit beyond this range, it counts as a remote service.

### **Summoning**

You can summon spirits of your tradition. Summoning a spirit is a Complex Action. Each summoning action can only call one spirit at a time and it only hangs around for a limited time – a summoned spirit will return to wherever it was when you called it when it’s either through with all of the services it owes you or based on your tradition (such as when the sun rises or sets). You can only have one unbound spirit at any given time.

**Choose Spirit Type & Force**: You can only choose a spirit of a type available to your tradition. You also need to choose the spirit’s Force (the higher the Force the more powerful the spirit), up to twice your Magic rating.

**Attempt Summoning**: Make an Opposed Test using Summoning + Magic [Astral] v the spirit’s Force. If you get no net hits, you have failed to summon the spirit. If you get net hits, the spirit arrives nearby in astral space, owing you one service per net hit. The nature of the services the spirit can provide depends on the type of spirit and its Force and powers.

**Resist Drain**: Whether you successfully summon the spirit or not, you must resist Drain from the attempt. The Drain Value is equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit’s defence test, with a minimum Drain Value of 2. If the spirit’s Force is greater than your Magic rating, the Drain is Physical; otherwise, it’s Stun.

**Glitches**: A glitch on conjuring can result in the wrong spirit type (but still one within the summoner’s tradition), a spirit of lesser force (who makes the Opposed Test at the Force the summoner selected) or extra Drain to resist.

On a critical glitch, Drain may not be resisted at all or double the Drain must be resisted or the spirit could be summoned, but not under the summoner’s control – wishing to have a “conversation” about how some spirits feel the practices of summoning and binding is a form of slavery.

### **Binding**

Binding is used summon a spirit and bind it to you so that you may later call it to perform services for you. This takes one hour per Force of the spirit being bound. The test is an Opposed Binding + Magic [Astral] against the spirit’s Force x2, and inflicts Drain equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit’s defence test, minimum 2. Additional net hits beyond the first add to the number of services the spirit owes to a maximum of the spirit’s Force x2.

Once the spirit is bound, its service ends when it has no more services owed to the magician. The bound spirit can be called or dismissed with a Simple Action as they appear next to the magician from the metaplane, awaiting further instructions on the astral. A magician can bind up to their Charisma attribute in spirits.

### **Banishing**

Banishing is severing the bond between a spirit and its summoner. Banishing is a Complex Action. You make an Opposed Banishing + Magic [Astral] Test. This test is opposed by the spirit’s Force (+ the summoner’s Magic if the spirit is bound). For every net hit you get, the number of services the spirit owes is reduced by 1. If you reduce the spirit’s owed services to zero, it’s free and departs on its next action.

The Drain Value for banishing is equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit’s defence test, with a minimum Drain Value of 2. If the spirit’s Force is greater than your Magic rating, the Drain is Physical, otherwise it’s Stun.

When the bond is broken, the spirit returns to its own plane. This is not the same as disrupting a spirit and forcing it back to its home plane – while it interrupts the spirit the spirit at what it’s doing and may be annoying, banishing is not as downright unpleasant as disruptions (and a spirit engaged in a tedious task might not mind being banished in the least).

### **Spirit Services**

Services are how we measure how helpful a spirit is willing (or required) to be to you. A service is a single task that you request (or demand) from a spirit. If the spirit’s time is up, then any services it still owes are lost to you. The services a spirit can perform are based on whether or not it’s bound to you. Each of the following cost a service.

#### **Unbound Spirit Services**

**Combat**: You can have a spirit fight on your side in combat. The entire fight counts as a single service.

**Power Use**: You can have a spirit use one of its powers on a target or targets of your choosing. If the spirit uses a power as part of another task (often in combat), then the power use doesn’t count as a separate service.

**Physical Task**: A spirit can materialise to perform actions on the physical plane for you.

**Remote Service**: If you send a spirit to complete a service beyond your Magic rating x 100 metres, it’s a remote service. Once the spirit is done with a remote service, it is released and goes to its home metaplane, no matter how many services it still owes you.

#### **Bound Spirit Services**

**Unbound Spirit Service**: You can have a bound spirit do any of the things an unbound spirit can do for you. If you have a bound spirit perform a remote service, you don’t lose any extra services when it’s done and it comes back to you when it’s finished.

**Aid Alchemy, Sorcery and Study**: As a service, the spirit can add its Force as a dice pool bonus to your Alchemy, Spellcasting, Ritual Spellcasting and Learning Tests if its type matches the spell’s category, as listed under your tradition.

**Spell Sustaining**: You can have a spirit sustain a spell for you after you cast it. It takes the -2 dice pool penalty per sustained spell, instead of you. It can’t do this forever, only for its Force in Combat Turns for each service you spend on spell sustaining.

### **Common Spirit Powers**

Spirits are denizens of the metaplanes. They’re usually only found when a magician summons them, but there are many free spirits who live unbound on the material plane. They only have physical attributes when materialised in the physical plane. Most spirits possess the common powers listed below.

|Astral Form|<p>A spirit with this power only exists in the astral plane. Only astral attacks or mana spells/powers may hurt a spirit; physical attacks or spells/powers have no effect. The reverse is also true; the spirit can only affect dual-natured beings or those on the astral plane, whether through astral projection or astral perception.</p><p>Spirits may manifest on the physical plane in the same way as astrally projecting magicians.</p>|
| :- | :- |
|Materialisation|This spirit can project themselves into the physical world and form a temporary “body” to inhabit while they’re here. This lets it interact with, and affect, physical beings. Additionally, it gains Spirit Armour equal to twice its Essence. Materialising and dematerializing to return to the astral plane both require a Complex Action.|
|Spirit Armour|Spirits are harmed more by the force of will behind an attack than the physical attack itself. Mana spells and/or powers deal their normal damage to spirits. The DV of normal melee attacks is the Willpower of the attacker while Strength and similarly physical modifiers are ignored. Standard firearms do not penetrate Spirit Armour as there is no individual’s will behind the force of the bullets. However, a thrown weapon such as a knife may still have the will of the attacker backing it up and therefore able to deal damage to the spirit with a DV of Willpower/2 (round up).|

**<a name="_toc218024805"></a>ENCHANTING**\

==========================================
Enchanting is the technique of tapping into the fundamental power latent in natural elements and imbuing items with magic that aids and enhances a magician’s abilities. With it, you can enchant items with spells, create magical foci and break down magical items into component reagents.

### **Alchemy**

From mystic flamethrowers to preparing a six-demon bag, alchemy allows the magician to prepare objects that hold a spell to be released later. The object used as a preparation must be small enough for the magician to lift, handle and manipulate. The magician alters, marks, sculpts or otherwise adds a creative touch to the object in the process of making it a preparation. This also makes it recognisable as a preparation with a successful Arcana + Intuition [Mental] Test.

Preparations carry an aura with the astral signature of its creator, which is visible in astral space. The aura and astral signature lasts for a number of hours equal to the magical effect’s Force after activation. Preparations which, when active, sustain a spell, become temporarily dual-natured while the spell is active.

**Choose an Alchemy Formula**: You can only choose an alchemical formula you know. Alchemical formulae are different from Sorcery spells even if they result in the same effect.

**Choose Formula Force**: You must declare the Force at which your preparation will be created. The Force acts as a limit on the preparation, so higher Force preparations are more powerful, but at the cost of more Drain. You can make a preparation at a Force up to twice your Magic rating.

**Choose the Lynchpin for the Preparation**: The object for the preparation is called the lynchpin. It must be small enough for you to lift, handle and manipulate. In addition, the lynchpin must not have any aura already, so living beings are right out.

**Choose Preparation Trigger**: A preparation releases its spell when a condition called the trigger is met. Choose a trigger type for the preparation. The trigger you pick can add to the Drain Value of the preparation.

*Command*: The preparation is triggered by you. You must be on the physical plane (or manifest if you’re astrally projecting), have line of sight to the preparation and take a Simple Action to trigger the preparation. You have some control over the preparation’s target with this trigger.

*Contact*: The next living being to touch the preparation activates the spell. This trigger adds +1 Drain.

*Reading*: The preparation is triggered by reading the inscribed/painted/written words/runes/sigils. This trigger adds +1 Drain.

*Time*: Choose an amount of time when picking this trigger. The countdown starts at the end of the creation of the preparation and the preparation is activated when the time’s up. The time you declare is limited by the final Potency of the preparation in hours – if the time is greater than the resulting Potency after creation, the preparation activates prematurely. This trigger adds +2 Drain to the creation of the preparation.

**Create the Preparation**: Once everything else is settled, you need to spend uninterrupted time crafting the lynchpin into a preparation – a number of minutes equal to the preparation’s Force. You spend this time drawing arcane formulae, carving symbols or hieroglyphs, mixing materials into the lynchpin or some other time-honoured way of working your magic that relates to your tradition – the higher the Force, the more complex and intricate your work.

After the time elapses for creation of the preparation, make an Alchemy + Magic [Force] Test opposed by the Force of the preparation. The net hits from this test becomes the preparation’s Potency. If you get no net hits, the Preparation fails, the time is wasted and you still take drain.

**Resist Drain**: Drain for a preparation is based on the alchemical formula, plus any additional Drain based on the chosen trigger. If you get more hits on your Alchemy Test than your Magic rating, the Drain is Physical, otherwise it’s Stun.

**Glitches**: On a glitch, you may have put the wrong trigger on the preparation or the duration of a time trigger could be off or the preparation may resist at a higher force than usual (+2 to Force). On a critical glitch – well, we wouldn’t recommend drinking whatever the end result is. It may blow up in your hand when you move it. Or something equally unpleasant your gamesmaster comes up with. It’s probably best just to step away (or run) from the preparation until the Potency fades.

**The Finished Preparation**: An alchemical preparation is a temporary form of magic. The preparation’s Potency determines how many hours the magic can be sustained and how strong the preparation’s spell is when activated. The preparation maintains full Potency for [Potency x2] hours. For every hour that passes after that period, the preparation’s Potency is reduced by 1.

### **Alchemical Preparation Formulae Examples**

#### **Boneshatter Rune**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-6||
Inscribed upon a weapon its magical power remains inert until awoken by tracing a finger over the rune. Then the next strike channels bone-shattering energies into the foe, adding Physical damage equal to the preparation’s Potency, resisted with Body.

#### **Camouflage Cloak**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F-2|Realistic|

A cloak is the most common lynchpin for this effect. With hermetic mages stitching runes of power around the edges. The wearer is coloured in a camouflage pattern that matches their surroundings and provides one die per hit to resist attempts to spot their physical body. This effect works against living viewers and technological sensors.

#### **Explosive Runes**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Elemental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-1||
Upon the inscribed runes being read, an explosion of flames flash into existence and scorch the surrounds. Fire damage equal to the preparation’s Potency + Force is dealt with a Fire AP equal to the preparation’s Force in a radius in metres equal to the Force of the preparation. To determine if something in the explosion range catches fire, roll Armour Value + Fire Resistance – Fire AP. The threshold on this test is the Potency of the preparation. If caught on fire, at the end of each Combat Turn, the fire has an initial DV of 3 and the DV increases by 1 at the start of each subsequent Combat turn until the item is completely destroyed or the fire is put out. You can fight the fire in a number of ways (water, smothering, etc.) making an Agility + Intuition Test and reducing the fire’s DV by 1 for each hit.

#### **Eye of Awareness**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F|Psychic|

Commonly prepared using an amulet or necklace as the lynchpin, when activated, your awareness expands, allowing you to subconsciously analyse combat and other dangerous situations with range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Each point of Potency grants a +1 dice pool bonus to Surprise Tests and against ranged and melee attacks.

#### **Featherfall Token**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F-3||
Often a small circular token that is snapped to slow a target’s fall to help them land safely without suffering fall damage. When determining the maximum distance (in metres) the target may fall without danger of injury, multiply the successes on the Potency + Force [Force] Test by the spell’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the spell before calculating damage.

#### **Mindnet**

|Type: Mana|Range: F x M x 10m|Extended Area|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Hr/F|Drain: F+1|Psychic|

A small copper net that fits in the palm of your hand is the typical lynchpin. Mindnet allows telepathic communication between a group of voluntary people. To connect to the Mindnet, one must touch a strand of the net. Everyone in the group can freely talk and emote as long as they remain within range of the lynchpin.

#### **Mist Globe**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-4|Area|

A tiny, glass globe the size of a marble that appears to contain swirling mist. When shattered, a thick fog rapidly blankets the area proving dense and difficult to see through, imposing a visibility modifier equal to the Potency. The mist can be dissipated by temperature and winds.

#### **Painstone**

|<a name="_hlk212804858"></a>Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F-4||
This jagged-edged stone absorbs the pain of injuries that would otherwise be felt by the user. It is activated by drawing a drop of the user’s blood on the sharp stone. The user ignores the pain of injuries, reducing penalties from Physical or Stun damage. The activation test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). Each hit on the Potency + Force [Force] Test removes the effect of one point of wound penalties.

### **Using a Preparation**

When the spell is released from the preparation, it goes off as though it were cast by a magician. The preparation uses Potency + Force [Force]. If the effect is sustained, it lasts for a duration as listed in the alchemical preparation formula. There is no Drain in this because it was already taken by the alchemist; likewise, no Edge can be spent on the preparation activation.

The target(s) of a preparation must be on the physical plane.

### **Artificing**

Enchanting is the technique of tapping into the fundamental power latent in natural elements and imbuing items with magic that aids and enhances a magician’s abilities. The act of creating a magical focus is known as artificing. Unlike other magical goods, a focus is powerful, reusable and intimately tied to its owner. A focus represents a permanent and complex enchantment built up slowly from an arcane formula and finished with Karm. All foci follow the same basic creation process: first a focus formula is needed, then an appropriate telesma (the material item to be enchanted) is selected. After that the enchantment proper is created and finally the finished focus is bonded.

**Choose Focus Formula**: Designing a focus requires a complex arcane recipe known as a focus formula. Focus formulae, like all magical formulae, are produced using the Arcana skill. They are too complex for metahuman magicians to memorise and must be recorded in some fashion. You can buy focus formulae from lore stores and talismongers.

All focus formulae specify the type of focus, Force, form and tradition of the focus. The formulae sold by talismongers typically use “traditional” forms in widespread magical traditions – which is why a lot of magicians commonly create their own formulae. The focus formula must be for a Force that is equal to or less than your Magic Rating – you cannot make foci with ratings greater than your Magic rating.

If you’d rather create your own focus formula, you can design one from scratch. Researching a focus formula is an Arcana + Magic [Astral] (Force x Force, 1 day) Extended Test. Once complete, the focus formula may be used by any magician of your tradition to make the specific focus. A magician can translate a focus formula from another tradition into their own with an Arcana + Magic [Astral] (Force, 1 day) Extended Test.

**Obtain the Telesma**: Before you can create a focus, you need to acquire an item that matches the form defined in the focus formula. An object being prepared for enchantment in this manner is known as a telesma. Obtaining telesma may be simple or complex – if the formula calls for a knife it may be no more difficult than buying a blade from the local Weapons World franchise, but if the formula calls for a flute carved from the bones of a California condor, you might need to do some work to track down the item in question. Any inanimate object can serve as the telesma: a wooden wand, a jewelled charm, a weapon, an oddly shaped stone, and so on. The more unprocessed and natural the object, or the more work you performed to craft it, the easier the telesma is to enchant. For this reason, enchanters with the technical or artistic skill to do so often create telesma themselves.

**Prepare the Magical Lodge**: You’ll need a magical lodge with a Force at least equal to that of the formula Force, and of the same tradition as yourself and the focus formula. While you’re there, make sure you add some amenities, because you’re going to be in there for a while.

**Spend Reagents**: The reagents you need specified in the focus formula. Consumable reagents are considered spent at the start of the process, so they are used up even if you fail or abort the crafting.

**Craft the Focus**: You need to spend a number of days equal to the Force in the focus formula. You use this time to gather mana, hanging it on the telesma and working it into the material permanently. You’re actually working sporadically over the course of each day, so you can do other business during this time, but you can’t leave the lodge without ruining your crafting attempt.

At the end of the crafting time, it is time for the dangerous part of the process: invoking the power of the focus. Make an Artificing + Magic [formula Force] v formula Force + telesma’s Object Resistance. This counts as the culmination of all your work over the days, so you can’t use Edge for this test. Your net hits from this test, if you succeed, become the focus’s actual Force. If you glitch, you cannot resist Drain in the next step. If you critically glitch, the magic spins out of your control and rips away Essence from you – artificing is not for the weak or untrained.

**Resist Drain**: The Drain Value is the Force specified by the focus formula, plus 2 for each hit (not net hit) rolled against you in the Artificing test; the Drain is Physical if the actual Force of the focus somehow ends up greater than your Magic rating. If you’re still conscious after resisting Drain, you can spend an amount of karma equal to the actual Force of the focus to seal the deal and finish the focus. If you fall unconscious or don’t want to keep the result, skip the karma expenditure and start over (probably after you’ve healed).

The Artificing skill also allows you to assense a focus in a way that helps you understand its creator. Make an Opposed Test of Artificing + Magic [Astral] v twice the Force of the focus. You can use the net hits to learn about the aura of the artificer who crafter it. This can be attempted once a day per focus.

### **Disenchanting**

The Disenchanting skill allows the magician to temporarily disrupt or even unweave astral constructs.

**Disenchant**: To deactivate an active focus, make an Opposed Disenchanting + Magic [Astral] v the target‘s Force + owner’s Magic Test. You can do this from the physical or astral plane, though you must have line of sight to the focus. If you get more successes on the test, the focus deactivates.

The Drain Value for this test is 1 Stun per hit (not net hit) rolled against the magician; if the target’s Force exceeds the magician’s Magic rating, the Drain is Physical. If the target’s Force exceeds twice their Magic rating, then that item’s a bit more than the mage can handle and they cannot successfully perform Disenchant.

**Disjunction**: A focus can be destroyed and broken down into reagents. This requires touch contact with the focus. Breaking down a focus requires an Opposed Disenchanting + Magic [Astral] v the target’s Force (+ owner’s Magic if bonded and if the focus isn’t yours) Test. If you succeed in this test, the focus ceases to be. The telesma at the heart of it disintegrates and is unusable.

The mana released can be channelled into objects of the magician’s tradition, making them into reagents. Make an Alchemy + Magic [Astral] Test. Every success creates one reagent, up to a maximum of half of the reagents used in creating the focus. This process takes a number of hours equal to the target’s Force.

The Drain Value for these tests are 1 Stun per hit (not net hit) rolled against the magician; if the target’s Force exceeds the magician’s Magic rating, the Drain is Physical. If the target’s Force exceeds twice their Magic rating, then that item’s a bit more than the mage can handle and they cannot successfully perform Disjunction.

**Disjoining**: Put simply, disjoining is to Alchemy as dispelling is to Spellcasting. Disjoining allows you to remove the magic power from a preparation, making it into an ordinary object again. To disjoin a preparation, you need to have assensed the object and you need to touch it to make the attempt. Disjoining takes a Complex Action and you make an Opposed Disenchanting + Magic [Astral] Test v the preparation’s Force + the alchemist’s Magic Rating. Every net hit reduces the preparation’s Potency by 1. You then take the same amount of Drain as you would have if you’d created the preparation yourself.

There’s a risk to doing this – if the preparation has a contact trigger and you fail the Disenchanting Test, the preparation activates. Better hope it’s not explosive.

**<a name="_toc218024806"></a>SORCERY**\

=======================================
Sorcery is the art of shaping mana to create specific effects. You can use it to cast spells (Spellcasting and Ritual Spellcasting) or protect against or destroy spells (Counterspelling). You need to concentrate to cast a spell, but traditions may also include chanting, gestures, dancing or other actions to go along with it.

This specialisation of Perception is called Numinous Perception, which includes both the chilly tingle of astral forms and the “vibes” of noticing magic. With a Simple Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test with a threshold equal to the absolute value of the Skill Rating of the caster minus the Force of the magic (minimum 1).

Obviously, it a magician is throwing fire from their fingertips, you’re probably going to notice without making a test. But if the magic is subtle, then you have to pick up some dice.

### **Spellcasting**

Select a known spell. Select the target(s). Select the spell’s Force.

You need to be able to establish a link to your target – depending on the spell, you’ll need to be able to see or touch the target in order to establish the mystical link.

If you need to see the target, line of sight can be established with your natural vision, including using reflective surfaces and looking through transparent objects. Cyber- or bio-ware visual enhancements that have been paid for this Essence count as natural.

Any technological visual aid that digitises or augments the visual input for you (a camera, electronic binoculars, Matrix feeds, etc) doesn’t work – you’re looking at a generated image, not the light from the real target.

Spellcasting by visual targeting is subject to normal visibility modifiers. You can target astral targets when you’re in astral space (you’re not technically seeing them, but the analogy works).

Some spells can only be cast on target that you’re touching. You don’t need to see these targets, but you might need to make an unarmed attack to make contact with an unwilling target. Touching a target through clothing, armour or layer of paint is acceptable.

A magician in the physical world can only cast spells on targets that are in the physical world. Similarly, a magician in astral space can only cast spells on targets that are present in astral space.

If you’re using astral perception (or are dual-natured), you can cast spells on targets in either the physical world or the astral plane. Only mana-based spells work in astral space, even if you’re in the physical world astrally perceiving the target.

The Force of a spell acts as a limit on the spell. Higher Force spells are more powerful but cause more Drain. You can cast a spell at a Force of up to twice your Magic Rating. If the number of hits (not net hits) you get after applying the limit exceeds your Magic rating, the spell’s Drain is Physical instead of Stun damage.

Casting a spell involves some mental preparation and a Complex Action. Make a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] Test, including dice pool modifiers, for injury, sustained spells and so on. Any opposition roll or threshold you need to reach is listed in the spell description.

**Rapid Spellcasting**: You can bypass some of the preparation, but it can take a toll on your body. Rapid Spellcasting lets you cast a spell as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action, but with an added +3 Drain Value. If you decide to cast two spells Simple Actions in the same Action Phase, both receive the +3 Drain Value.

**Determine Effect**: Details on the type of spell are listed under each spell. Some spells require an Opposed Test prior to resolution, while others can possibly be dodged by the target. Note that the effect takes space even if Drain takes you out.

**Drain**: Drain calculation is listed for each spell; the Drain Value is determined using the Force and the listed calculation but can never be lower than 2. After casting a spell, you must resist Drain using the dice pool for Drain Resistance according to your tradition.

**Determine Ongoing Effects**: If you sustain the spell (that is, if you want the effect of a Sustained spell to continue), you take a dice pool penalty to all tests while it is sustained as noted in the spell description. You can sustain multiple spells, but the penalty is cumulative for each spell.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a spell might cause extra drain (generally a +2 Drain Value), invoke a different elemental effect than what was intended, hit the wrong target or any other bit of mischief your gamesmaster can think up. On a critical glitch, the spell could get away from you and cause all sorts of havoc or you might not get to resist Drain or it could go off in an unconventional and unpredictable manner that could harm you or your team – again, your gamesmaster gets to decide what happens.

### **Spell Characteristics**

**Type**: Spells are either Physical spells (P) or Mana spells (M).

**Range**: This describes how close you have to get or how far away you can be to cast the spell. The most common range is Line of Sight (LOS). Some spells require you to Touch (T) the target – if the target is unwilling, you’ll need to make an unarmed attack against the target.

**Area**: Area spells (A) affect an area rather than a single target. With a few exceptions, the area is a radius in meters equal to the Force of the spell.

**Damage**: If the spell inflicts damage, this describes the type – either Physical (P) or Stun (S). The Damage Value for the spells is listed in the spell or spell category description.

**Duration**: This describes how long the spell’s effect lasts. Instantaneous (I) spells have an effect that happens and then fades, while Sustained (S) spells last as long as you keep them going. Permanent (P) spells don’t fade or dissipate; their effect becomes a lasting, non-magical characteristic after you sustain the spell for (Force) Combat Turns.

**Drain**: This is the formula used to calculate the Drain Value inflicted by a spell. It is based on the Force (F) of the spell and can never be below 2.

**Indirect**: All indirect combat spells originate near the magician’s body (most magicians use their hands or eyes, but some use their feet for “power kicks” or emanate power from the entire body for a kind of an aura-throwing effect). So, you don’t really need to be able to see the target – you can cast these spells blindfolded or with artificial image enhancement – as long as you’ve got a clear line of fire.

### **Physical vs Mana**

**Physical spells**: When using Physical spells, the magician converts the channelled mana to energy and/or tangible material in the physical world. The tangible material is simple – energy or matter such as ice, acid, oxygen, heat, light, etc. This material is also temporary unless sustained, converting back to mana energy when the spell ends. Physical spells can affect both living and non-living objects in the physical world.

**Mana spells**: When using Mana spells, the magician can only affect living things with auras or astrally active entities (such as spirits or foci) even in the physical world. Mana spells can affect targets on either the physical or astral planes, but only if you’re on the same plane as your target(s).

### **Spell Categories**

**Combat**: These spells are quick, dirty and violent. The energy of the spell is used to harm, main or otherwise frag the target. Spell energy may be channelled directly into the target or it may generate external energy to damage the target from the outside.

**Detection**: These spells enhance the senses. They may allow the subject of the spell to see or hear over great distances or grant new sensory abilities. There are also Detection spells to sense the presence of other beings, magic, life and/or enemies.

**Health**: These spells affect the condition and performance of a living body. They can be used to treat or heal injuries, purge poisons or toxins and increase or decrease Attributes.

**Illusion**: These spells can mess with a target’s perception. They can be used to deceive, make things invisible, confuse the senses or provide simple or complex entertainments.

**Manipulation**: These spells are used by magicians to alter and shape their environment in a variety of ways. They can control the emotions or actions of a person, move objects, shape, create or channel energy or change a target’s form or appearance by altering its structure.

### **Combat Spells**

**Blaze**

This spell channels destructive magical power into the target, doing Physical damage. The damage inflicted is similar to massive cellular die off from radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but without the continuing effects. Since they are mana spells, they only affect living and magical targets. It inflicts damage equal to your net hits on a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] Test resisted by Willpower.

**Fireball**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Damage: P|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F|Aimed|

The magician creates an explosion of flames that flash into existence and scorch the target(s), giving them the double benefit of causing pain and being intimidating as hell. The area of effect is a radius in meters equal to the Force of the spell. The spell is targeted with a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] versus the target’s Reaction + Intuition.  It strikes the target dealing Force + net hits damage, with an AP equal to –(Force) and resisted by Body + Fire Resistance. Roll an Armour Value + Fire Resistance –[Force]. The threshold on this test is the net hits rolled on the fire-based attack. On a fail, the target is set on fire.

It inflicts damage equal to your net hits on a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] Test resisted by Body + Cold Resistance. If at least one damage is inflicted, the target has a limb (or limbs) immobilised. The target may attempt to break free with a Complex Action, rolling Strength + Body against the net hits of the spell.

**Frost Shards**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Damage: P|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3|Aimed|

The magician directs a flurry of icy wind and shards of ice at the target with a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] versus the target’s Reaction + Intuition.  It strikes the target dealing Force + net hits damage, with an AP equal to –(Force) and resisted by Body + Cold Resistance. This may damage gear as liquid components freeze, lubricants gum up and other parts become brittle.

**Ice Sheet**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F|Area|

### **Detection Spells**

**Clairaudience**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The listening point may be moved to another point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. A ward or mana barrier prevents the visual point from entered that area. The range of the listening point is Force x Magic in metres and does not require line of sight. While using Clairaudience, the subject cannot use their normal hearing. This spell translates only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing.

**Clairvoyance**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The visual point may be moved to another point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. A ward or mana barrier prevents the visual point from entered that area. The range of the visual point is Force x Magic in metres and does not require line of sight. While using Clairvoyance, the subject cannot use their normal vision or astral perception. This spell translates only vision and doesn’t work with augmented vision. You can’t target spells through Clairvoyance.

**Detect Life**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Active|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Area|

The subject can attempt to detect all living being (but not spirits) within range of the sense and their number and relative location. The range of detection is Force x Magic in metres. The net hits determine the level of the information provided. In a crowded area, the spell is virtually useless, picking up a blurred mass of traces of life.

**Detect Magic**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Active|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-2|Area|

The subject can attempt to detect the presence of all foci, spells, wards, magical lodges, alchemical preparations, active rituals and spirits within range of the sense. The range of detection is Force x Magic in metres. The net hits determine the level of the information provided. It does not detect Awakened characters or critters, astral signatures, alchemical preparations that have expired or already triggered or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.

**Diagnose**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Active|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3||
Diagnose grants the subject information on the target’s general health and any illnesses, injuries or other mundane medical problems the target might possess. The net hits determine the level of the information provided. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell

**Low-Light Vision**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject gains low-light vision for the duration of the spell.

**Thermographic Vision**

| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject gains thermographic vision for the duration of the spell.

### **Health Spells**

**Ambidexterity**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: \*|Drain: F-3||
This spell allows the spellcaster to temporarily grant ambidexterity, handling objects equally well with either hand. The subject does not suffer the -2 dice pool penalty for actions with the off-hand. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). The duration is equal to the spell’s Force + net hits on the Spellcasting Test in Combat Turns.

**Detoxify**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-3||
This spell is used to attempt to overcome toxins and poisons. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). Add the hits from this spell directly to the hits from the Toxin Resistance Test.

**Heal**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: S-P|Drain: F-4||
Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell’s hits from the Spellcasting Test. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). The effect becomes a lasting, non-magical characteristic after being sustained for (Force) Combat Turns. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.

**Increase Reflexes**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -3|Drain: F||
This spell increases the initiative of a subject. Each hit rolled on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 to the target’s Initiative and every two hits adds one Initiative Die. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time and the maximum Initiative Dice anyone can have is +5D6. The bonus does not stack with Initiative bonuses gained through cyberware.

**Resist Pain**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-4||
This spell allows the subject to ignore the pain of injuries, reducing penalties from Physical or Stun damage. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). Each hit on the Spellcasting Test removes the effect of one point of wound penalties. A person can only be under the effects of one Resist Pain spell at a time (the one with the most hits).

**Stabilise**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: S-P|Drain: F-4||
When applied to a character with a filled Physical damage track, this spell stabilises all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). The effect becomes a lasting, non-magical characteristic after being sustained for Combat Turns equal to the overflow damage. The spell must be sustained until the full time is taken for the spell to become permanent before the character is truly stabilised; hits reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow.

### **Illusion Spells**

**Agony**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-4|Single Sense|

A favourite of mages going through bad break-ups, Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on the target. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, they are racked with pain, unable to move or act. The spell is resisted with a Logic + Willpower Test against using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Test. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.

**Agony, Mass**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Area, Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-2|Single Sense|

Mass Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on targets with a radius of [Force] metres. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, they are racked with pain, unable to move or act. The spell is resisted with a Logic + Willpower Test against using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Test. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.

**Full Sensory Illusionary Mask**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-1|Multi-Sense|

The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape as their natural form) chosen by the magician. This spell alters the subject’s appearance, voice, scent and other sensory characteristics as well.

Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Tests with an Intuition + Logic Test. This spell creates an illusion that affects both living beings and technological systems. It does not affect auras.

**Invisibility**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-2|Single-Sense|

This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by other senses (hearing, smell, touch and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Their aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell with a Logic + Willpower Test. Make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if their good enough with their Sneaking Test.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers.

**Sound Barrier**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Area, Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Single-Sense|

The spellcaster creates a perimeter of silence around the area of effect, (Force) in metres. Those inside the sound barrier cannot hear outside noises but can hear sounds within the globe and vice versa. Sound Barrier also affects technological devices, infrasound and ultrasound.

**Visual Illusionary Mask**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-4|Single Sense|

The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape as their natural form) chosen by the magician. This spell only alters the subject’s visual appearance.

Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Tests with a Logic + Willpower Test. This spell creates an illusion that affects the minds of living beings and is ineffective against technological systems. It does not affect auras.

**Voice From Everywhere**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Area, Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-4|Single Sense|

The strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown You project your mystical energy through your voice. Your voice seems to come from everywhere and nowhere specific in the room (or area). It leaves those who hear your voice unable to detect your location from the sound. While able to hear your voice, they don’t know where you are. You could be anywhere: even right behind them.

### **Manipulation Spells**

**Armour**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-2||
This spell creates a field of magical energy wrapped around the subject’s aura that protects against Physical Damage. It provides Armour equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armour.

**Catfall**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-3||
A spellcaster may utilise Catfall to slow a target’s fall to help them land safely without suffering fall damage. When determining the maximum distance (in metres) the target may fall without danger of injury, multiply the spellcaster’s hits by the spell’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the spell before calculating damage.

**Deflection**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-1||
Deflection grants the spellcaster the ability to cast a spell of protection over a willing target. Every hit scored grants the target a +1 dice pool bonus for defending against ranged physical attacks. The effects of this spell are subtle enough to be discounted as a missed shot or poor aim (at least at first).

**Light**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-4|Area|

This spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around it equal to the spell’s Force in meters. This spell cannot be used to blind a target, but it offsets darkness visibility modifiers. Each hit on the Spellcasting Test counters a -1 dice pool penalty due to light conditions.

**Lock**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-2||
Lock allows the spellcaster to telekinetically hold a door (or portal, hatch, closure or similar blockage) closed with a Strength equal to the Force. Opening the portal requires an Opposed Test between Strength and the spell’s Force.

**Mist**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3|Area|

Mist creates a thick fog that blankets the entire area of effect. The mist is dense and difficult to see through, imposing a visibility modifier equal to the hits scored by the caster. The mist dissipates quickly based on the surrounding temperature and winds. Generally speaking, this means the vision modifier is reduced by 1 per Combat Turn, modified by the temperature and winds.

**Sterilise**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3|Area|

This spell allows a spellcaster to kill all bacteria (and other microorganisms) and destroy organic material such as skin flakes, stray hairs and spilled blood. Material affected by this spell cannot be used as a material link. Because the spell does not affect biomaterial attached to a living being, it does not kill the various helpful and harmful microorganisms living inside a creature. Each hit scored by the caster inflicts a -1 dice pool penalty to any skill tests made to collect and use sterilised biomaterial for forensics purposes. Shadowrunners often employ this spell to eliminate incriminating trace evidence, especially if blood has been spilled. The area sterilised equals the caster’s Magic Rating in cubic metres.

### **Counterspelling**

Counterspelling offers the magician two benefits: spell defence and dispelling. The Counterspelling skill does not work against spirits, critter powers or alchemical preparations.

**Spell Defence**: Spell Defence is used against hostile spells cast at you or at targets that are within your line of sight that you decide to protect with spell defence.

*Spell Shielding*: As a Bonus Action, select a number of people (including yourself if you desire) within 1 metre per point of Counterspelling skill. Dice equal to your Counterspelling skill are added to the defence test against spells of everyone you’re covering. This lasts until the end of the Combat Turn.

*Spellbreaking*: As an Interrupt Action that reduces your Initiative Score by 5, when a spellcaster is casting a spell. Make a Counterspelling + Magic [Astral] Test; each hit reduces the hits of the opposing spellcaster’s spellcasting test.

**Dispelling**: Dispelling is used to counter a sustained spell. A Dispelling Test is the dispeller’s Counterspelling + Magic [Astral] against the spell’s Force + caster’s Magic. Every net hit reduces the number of hits the caster had in casting the spell. This may reduce the effectiveness of the spell. If the spell is reduced to 0 net hits, the spell ends completely. Regardless of how it goes, you take the Drain from the spell as if you had cast it – Physical if the spell’s Force was higher than your Magic rating, Stun otherwise.

**Ritual Drain**: A ritual can be drained of power if it contains the “Spell” keyword and is ongoing (sustained or with a duration). Make an Opposed Counterspelling + Magic [Astral] Test against a dice pool equal to the sum of the Force of the spell and the total of the Magic Ratings of all the ritual’s participants. Every net hit you get reduces the net hits from the ritual’s sealing step by 1. You take drain equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the opposing test. The Drain from draining a ritual is Stun unless the ritual’s Force is greater than your Magic rating, in which case the Drain is Physical.

### **Ritual Spellcasting**

While spellcasting is the quick manipulation of mana, ritual spellcasting shapes mana over a longer period of time. More time allows you to manipulate mana in ways that normal spellcasting won’t allow. Rituals can be performed by either one person or a group.

**Choose Ritual Leader**: Each ritual must have a leader who know the ritual being performed and can complete the last step, which seals the ritual. The participants do not need to have learned the ritual; they simply must be willing to take part. All effects from the ritual have the leader’s **astral signature**. Participants who are not of the same tradition as the leader suffer a minimum of a -2 dice pool penalty on all actions for the ritual. If you’re casting a ritual all alone, you’re the leader.

**Choose Ritual**: The leader must then choose the ritual to perform. If required, the leader also chooses the spell that will be included as part of the ritual. If the ritual requires knowledge of a spell or spell category, only the leader needs to know them.

**Choose the Force**: The Force of the ritual determines not only its general power, but also the Force of any spell woven into it.

**Set Up the Foundation**: A ritual must be performed in a magical lodge appropriate to the leader’s tradition, which is referred to as the foundation for the ritual. This can be a permanent magical lodge, or a temporary one. The Force of the lodge must equal or exceed the Force of the ritual to be cast. Once the lodge is active, no participant (except a spotter, if the ritual calls for one) may leave the foundation until the ritual is complete without causing the ritual to fail.

**Perform the Ritual**: The duration of this step is specific to each ritual (see their descriptions), but is almost always based on the ritual’s Force.

**Seal the Ritual**: The final step in any ritual is sealing it, which completes the ritual. The leader makes a Ritual Spellcasting + Magic [Force] v (Force x2) test, with a Teamwork Test from each of the participants. Each ritual’s description explains how the net hits from the sealing step are used, if at all.

After the spell effect goes off, each participant also takes Drain equal to twice the number of hits (not net hits) on the defence side of the Ritual Spellcasting Test (minimum 2). If the number of hits the leader got on their Teamwork Test was higher than their Magic rating, this drain is Physical; otherwise, it’s Stun.

### **Ritual Failure**

There are a number of things that could cause a ritual to fail prematurely. If a participant leaves the foundation before the ritual is sealed, the ritual fails. If the leader is incapacitated (or killed) before the ritual is sealed, the ritual fails. If the foundation is disrupted or broken before the ritual is sealed, the ritual fails.

When a ritual fails, every participant immediately suffers Drain. Make a Force x 2 Test, as though the spell had actually been cast; the Drain is equal to twice the number of hits (not net hits) on this test in Stun damage.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a ritual in any step could result in extra Drain (e.g. +2 Drain Value), an increase of 2 to the Force resisting completion of the spell or the leader being forced to seal the ritual on their own. On a critical glitch, anything goes (prepare to put down that accidentally summoned demon, find that your astral form has been bound into the ritual focus item, find your healing circle is really an astral gateway and everybody just got dumped on some metaplane or something equally unpleasant).

### **Anchored Rituals**

An anchored ritual is anchored to a physical object (a tree or doorway, for example) or symbol/s of mystical significance to the tradition (written in ink, paint, blood, etch marks, etc.) that serves as the ritual’s focal point. This could be something used specifically for the ritual. While some anchored rituals create an effect that is simply a sphere expanding from the central focus, other allow the ritualist to shape the area of effect with tokens that resonate with the anchoring object or symbols mystically tied to the central symbol that allow the area to fit within the confines of a building or even certain rooms within a building. The anchor cannot be moved relative to the Gaiasphere (the planet) during the duration of the ritual’s effect or the ritual collapses and the effect ends early.

### **Rituals**

These are rituals that you can learn and cast.

**Alarm Ward**

Alarm Wards alert their creator when a physical form has entered or crossed any area they are set to guard (with a size threshold to prevent a mosquito from triggering the Alarm Ward. Alarm Wards are tenuous, designed to be as unobtrusive as possible so as to blend into the local astral space and allow any intruder to pass through, (hopefully) unaware they have been detected.

*Keywords*: Anchored

*Effect*: Astral entities must make an Assensing + Intuition [Astral] (3) Test to notice the ward before passing through it. Those on the physical realm or using spells like Clairvoyance need to succeed at a Perception Test (5) to notice the ritual marking and anchor of the ward. This is to notice the “magical markings” but not understand their intent. That is a standard Arcane Knowledge Test.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Astral Alarm Ward**

Astral Alarm Wards alert their creator when a spell or astral form has entered or crossed any area they are set to guard. Astral Alarm Wards are tenuous, designed to be as unobtrusive as possible so as to blend into the local astral space and allow any intruder to pass through, (hopefully) unaware they have been detected.

*Keywords*: Anchored

Those on the physical realm or using spells like Clairvoyance need to succeed at a Perception Test (5) to notice the ritual marking and anchor of the ward. This is to notice the “magical markings” but not understand their intent. That is a standard Arcane Knowledge Test.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Circle of Protection**

The circle of protection is a small astral and physical barrier. The barrier is dual-natured. Anyone or anything within the barrier is protected from outside physical objects and magical attacks. If something crosses the barrier from the inside, then the circle ends.

*Keywords*: Anchored

*Effect*: The circle acts as a combination of physical barrier and mana barrier with a Force equal to the Force of the ritual.

*Area*: Even though it’s called a circle, it creates a sphere around the anchor that has a radius in metres equal to the leader’s Magic Rating.

*Duration*: 1 hour per net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Dread Domain**

This ritual creates an area of that mystically broadcasts feelings of imminent danger, fear and unease to any living being who enters the domain. They simultaneously feel chilled and nervous. Their hackles rise and they feel slightly panicked. It does not affect the ritualist/s (however, other allies may not be excluded from the effects).

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: Characters that fail to resist suffer a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions for each net hit on the Sealing Test as long as they remain in the area of effect.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour per net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Safe Landing Zone**

This ritual creates an area that slows the fall of those who enter it, helping them to land safely without suffering falling damage.

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: When calculating the maximum distance (in metres) a character has fallen without danger of injury, multiply the ritualist’s hits by the ritual’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the ritual before calculating damage.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour per net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Silence Zone**

This ritual creates a perimeter of silence. Those inside the zone cannot hear outside noises but can hear sounds within the zone and vice versa. Only sounds crossing the zone are affected. It also affects technological devices, infrasound and ultrasound.

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: Perimeter of silence.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Shadowed Domain**

This ritual creates an area of mystical shadows and darkness that restricts vision (does not affect thermographic vision).

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: 2 Force for Partial Light, 4 Force for Dim Light and 6 Force for Total Darkness.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Ward**

The ward is a basic ritual, taught to many magicians that creates an astral barrier.

*Keywords*: Anchored

*Effect*: It creates an astral barrier with a Force equal to the Force of the ritual.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: Weeks equal to the net hits from the sealing of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Watcher**

Watchers are like spirits, but in actuality are entities born from the ritual leader’s own mind rather than the metaplanes. They are a creation of mana, woven with the personalities of the ritual participants. A watcher can speak any language its creators (which include the leader and participants) can speak. A watcher is bound only to the leader of the ritual and follows their orders. Unlike spirits, watchers do not have a telepathic link with the leader. They must communicate with words to pass on a message. A watcher is a minion. A character can’t have more minions at a time that their Charisma rating. A leader can dismiss a watcher bound to them as a Bonus Action. Watchers cannot be banished or counterspelled.

*Keywords*: Minion

*Duration*: Hours equal to Force times the net hits on the sealing test

*Ritual Time*: (Force) minutes to perform.

**<a name="_toc218024807"></a>MENTOR SPIRITS**\

==============================================
In the search for magical enlightenment, affiliation or purpose, many Awakened individuals are drawn toward certain animals, mythological figures or concepts. This may be an idol they grew up with, a tribal totem or something they look up to achieve in their life. It could also relate to their religious or magical beliefs. So strong are the feelings for this person or idea that once the individual Awakens, the idea takes a life of its own. It becomes what is known as a mentor spirit.

This mentor spirit is much like other spirits in that it has its own personality, but it’s not a spirit in the summon-and-banish sense of the term. It can be seen and heard by those it chooses and even physically interact with its followers. Your mentor spirit can have significant influence over you, giving you benefits when you remain true or punishing you if you go astray (sometimes with temporary reductions to your Magic rating).

There is no real understanding of the nature of mentor spirits but their goal is clear. They want to keep Awakened individuals on the path that helped introduce the mentor spirit to the Earth in the first place. Any Awakened character can connect with a mentor spirit by taking the Mentor Spirit quality.

### **Mentor Spirit Archetypes**

Each of the mentor spirits listed here represents an archetype. These archetypes are idealised as totem animals, deities and forces of nature by different cultures and traditions. The archetypes listed below serve merely as examples of different archetypes and are not meant to apply to all cultures – a totem animal considered a healer in one culture may be considered a deceiver in another.

Each archetype offers three advantages: one general bonus, one bonus that applied only to magicians and one that applies only to adepts. Each also has a disadvantage. Advantages and disadvantages apply at all times.

#### **Bear**

This mentor symbolises strength and protection. He is a healer and cannot turn down those in need without good reason and he defends those under his care. Bear is more than a gentle healer; he is a ferocious protector, disregarding his own safety in combat if wounded or if someone he is protecting is injured.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to resist damage (not including Drain)

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for Health spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 1 free level of Rapid Healing

**Disadvantages**

You might go berserk when you take Physical damage in combat or if someone under your care is badly injured. Make a Simple Charisma + Willpower Test (wound modifiers apply). You go berserk for 3 turns minus 1 turn per hit, so 3 or more hits avert the berserk rage entirely. If you’re already going berserk, increase the duration. When you’re berserk, you go after your attacker(s) without regard for your own safety. If you incapacitate the target(s) before the time is up, the berserk fury dissipates.

#### **Cat**

Cat is honoured in cultures around the world. Cat is often seen as the guardian of mystical secrets, including those involving the afterlife. She certainly knows many secrets but rarely decides to share them and never with anyone who is not worthy. She is stealthy, sly and arrogant. Cat toys with her prey – threatening, taunting and confusing her targets – rather than going directly for the kill.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to either Acrobatics or Stealth Tests (choose one)

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for Illusion spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Light Body

**Disadvantages**

Cat magicians toy with their prey. Unless you succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test at the start of combat, you cannot make an attack that incapacitates your target. If you take any Physical damage, all this playing around stops.

#### **Dog**

Dog is a loyal friend. He fights ferociously to defend his home and those under his protection. Dog protects people from harmful magic and dangerous spirits. Dog is loyal, generous and helpful to those who show him kindness. He is single-minded, often to the point of stubbornness.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Tracking Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Detection spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Improved Sense

**Disadvantages**

A Dog magician is stubbornly loyal. You can never leave someone behind, betray your comrades or let another sacrifice themselves in your place without making a successful Charisma + Willpower (3) Test.

#### **Dragonslayer**

This most heroic of mentor spirits is also the most fun loving. Though he fights to protect his own against all dangers, he loves a good party even more. He is a big brother who takes a friendly interest in everything his family does. Though sometimes naïve, he makes a staunch friend and a deadly enemy. The dragons he slays have changed with the times: current beasts include crime, pollution, corruption and, of course, actual dragons. Dragonslayer fights hard and plays hard. Once he has given his oath, he never breaks it. A Dragonslayer magician behaves with honour and respect and demands the same from those around him.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to one social skill of choice

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Combat spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 1 free level of Enhanced Accuracy (skill) and 1 free level of Danger Sense

**Disadvantages**

If you break a promise, whether by choice or accident, you take a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions until you make good on your promise or atone.

#### **Fitness Guru**

Often devoted to self-improvement, those who follow the mentor spirit of fitness treat their bodies as their greatest instrument. Proud not just of their appearance, but of the power and finesse of their motion and actions. A Fitness magician offers respect to those they deem deserve it but at least politeness to those who don’t. However, they demand that others show them respect.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Acrobatics Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Health spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Light Body

**Disadvantages**

Followers of this mentor spirit demand respect, especially to those they give it to. Once disrespected, they must succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test, or they will demand satisfaction against the slight.

#### **Eagle**

Eagle is the highest-flying bird in the sky, considered the most noble by many cultures. He is proud and solitary and sees everything happening in the world below. Eagles are noble defenders of the purity of nature. They are intolerant of those who do not share their views and have a strong distrust of technology and its tools. Those who damage nature are Eagle’s enemies and Eagle will brave great danger to defeat polluters and other evildoers.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Perception Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for summoning spirits of air

**Adept**: 1 free level of Combat Sense

**Disadvantages**

You get the Allergy – Mild Pollutants quality with no bonus Karma for this negative quality.

#### **Oak**

Followers of Oak are stalwart and silent. They listen to the world around them and calculate their next action. A follower may be slow to act, but when they make their move, they do it with conviction. He protects others, shielding small plants and moss from the elements. Strong shields, buildings and ships are made from Oak. Followers protect anyone they have agreed to defend steadfastly, even unto death.

#### **Rat**

Rat is found wherever humans and the things they discard are, for what other bounty can sustain him? Rat is a scavenger, a stealthy thief who takes what he needs to survive.

#### **Raven**

Raven is a harbinger of trouble in cultures worldwide. He is a trickster and a transformer, dark and devious. Raven thrives off the bounty of carnage and chaos but does not cause them – he merely knows an opportunity when he sees one. Raven loves to eat and rarely refuses an offer of food.

#### **Spider**

Spider is one of the more feared and despised totems in the Sixth World. The threat posed by insect spirits is never far from the world’s consciousness and most metahumans still group spiders together with insects (although they are arachnids, scientifically speaking). But the fear of spiders goes deeper than that. Metahumanity has an almost biological fear of spiders, and for good evolutionary reasons, but that isn’t all Spider is. As many cultures know, Spider is not just one thing.

Also known as Anansi, Iktomi or Grandfather Spider, this totem has adapted quite well to the Sixth World. In regions across the globe, Spider presents as a trickster, schemer and hunter. Followers of Spider embody all of these traits and see Spider not as a boogeyman, but as a wise and powerful patron.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Stealth Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Manipulation spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Spirit Claw (although, in this case it manifests as a fang).

**Disadvantages**

Spider followers, like their mentor, become anxious when events happen beyond their control. As such, they go to great lengths to limit the randomness of their encounters. When not following a plan or a plan doesn’t go according to plan, followers of Spider must pass a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test or suffer -2 to all rolls until a new plan is established.

#### **Wise Warrior**

The Wise Warrior is skilled in the art of war, for battle is an art to them, an exercise in the powers of the mind as well as the body. They study the tactics of their foes and overcome them through a combination of superior strategy and battle prowess. The Wise Warrior does not act out of savagery or battle-lust, but from a position of knowledge and wisdom. Wise Warriors must follow the warrior’s code of honour and conduct themselves properly or risk the loss of favour.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Leadership Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Combat spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 1 free level of Improved Ability on a Combat Skill

**Disadvantages**

If you act dishonourably or without courtesy, whether by choice or by accident, you take a -1 dice pool penalty to all actions until you atone for your behaviour.

**<a name="_toc218024808"></a>FOCI**\

====================================
Foci are more than mundane items with a dusting of mana to give them potency. They are astral constructs embedded within physical objects. When active, the design of the astral construct enhances mana energy so that the magician it is bonded to can draw upon it for a specific magical task. The physical form of a focus varies – amulets, belts, wands, walking sticks, cups, daggers, hip flasks, pens and so on and so forth – although most of the time a focus reflects the tradition of its maker. Foci have a Force Rating that measures their power.

You can’t use a focus unless you’ve bonded it to yourself (and you can’t bond foci unless you’re Awakened). Bonding a focus takes an hour per Force of the Focus, spent contemplating the object and synchronising its astral signature to yours. A focus can only be bound to one person at a time – the bonding process breaks the bond with the focus’s previous owner (if it had one).

` `Each focus has a specific power and must be active for you to use it. Activating a focus is a Simple Action. For a focus to remain active, it must be in the possession of the magician (worn, carried, hand-held, in a pocket or pouch, etc). Likewise, if you lose consciousness your foci deactivate. If you lose possession of a focus, it automatically deactivates and you lose all its benefits until you recover it and activate it again. You can deactivate a focus at any time with a Bonus Action.

All foci have auras that are visible from astral space and carry your astral signature. While activated, a focus also has an astral form. If you use astral projection, you also carry the astral form of any active foci you have. If you deactivate a focus while you’re projecting, its astral form disappears and you’ll need to go back to your body to reactivate it.

You can’t bond more foci that your Magic attribute and the maximum Force of all your bonded foci can’t exceed your Magic x5. Regardless of the number of bonded foci you have, only one focus may add its Force to a dice pool for any given test.

|**Focus Item**|**Bonding Cost (Karma)**|
| :- | :- |
|**Enchanting Focus**|Force x3|
|**Metamagic Focus**|Force x3|
|**Power Focus**|Force x6|
|**Qi Focus**|Force x2|
|**Spell Focus**|Force x2|
|**Spirit Focus**|Force x2|
|**Weapon Focus**|Force x3|

### **Focus Types**

There are several categories of foci: Enchanting, Power, Qi, Spirit, Sorcery and Weapon.

#### **Enchanting Foci**

**Alchemical**: An alchemical focus adds its Force in dice to any Alchemical Tests.

**Artificing**: An artificing focus adds its Force in dice to any Artificing Tests.

**Disenchanting**: When a disenchanting focus is in contact with another artifact, the magician can add dice equal to its Force to the Disenchanting Test.

#### **Power Foci**

Power foci temporarily increase your dice pools when using Sorcery, Conjuring or Enchanting.

**Conjuring**: A conjuring focus adds dice equal to its Force to Banishing, Binding and Summoning Tests.

**Enchanting**: An enchanting focus adds dice equal to its Force to Alchemy, Artificing and Disenchanting Tests.

**Sorcery**: A sorcery focus adds dice equal to its Force to Counterspelling, Ritual Magic and Spellcasting Tests.

#### **Qi Foci**

Qi foci only work for adepts. They channel mana into your adept powers. A qi focus can be an object, like other foci, but can also be worked into a body modification, like tattoos, ritual scarring and piercings. Each focus is specific to a single adept power at a specific level. While the focus is active, you get the power contained in it, or if you already have the power, the focus’s levels are added to your own (if it’s a power with levels).

#### **Spirit Foci**

Spirit foci empower a magician’s conjuring skills. Each spirit focus must be attuned to a specific type of spirit.

**Summoning**: A summoning focus adds dice equal to its Force to summoning attempts as long as the targeted spirit is in the same category as the focus.

**Banishing**: The banishing focus adds its Force to the limit of a magician’s Banishing Test as long as the target spirit is in the same category as the focus.

**Binding**: A binding focus helps a magician tie a spirit to them. The focus adds its Force in dice to the magician’s Binding Test as long as the spirit is in the same category as the focus.

#### **Sorcery Foci**

Sorcery foci empower a magician’s sorcery skills. Each sorcery focus must be attuned to a specific category of magic.

**Counterspelling**: A counterspelling focus adds dice equal to its Force to counterspelling attempts as long as the category of magic is the same category as the focus.

**Ritual Magic**: A ritual magic focus adds dice equal to its Force to Ritual Magic Tests as long as the category of magic is the same category as the focus.

**Spellcasting**: A spellcasting focus adds dice equal to its Force to Spellcasting Tests as long as the category of magic is the same category as the focus.

#### **Weapon Foci**

A weapon focus always has, unsurprisingly, the form of a melee weapon. It adds magical power to the melee attacks you make with it. When used in physical combat, it gives you its Force as a dice pool bonus on your melee Attack Test. You still rely on your Physical Attributes and skills in combat; the weapon focus merely makes you more effective.

A weapon focus is effective against astral forms too, whether you’re using astral perception or projection. It adds its Force to your Astral Combat Tests when you’re using it and you can take it along while astrally projecting. The damage of the weapon in astral combat is the same as it is in the physical world, except that you can decide between Stun or Physical damage.
