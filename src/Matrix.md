# **THE MATRIX**


## **What is the Matrix?**

We use it every day to read out email, pay our bills, talk to our friends and loved ones. It monitors our money, handles our utilities and manages the traffic on our streets. Billons of people use it constantly, from the hungry family in Redmond to the CEO in Neo-Tokyo and everyone in between. It is the Matrix, the digital world within a world made of fibre-optic cables, networks and more data and computing power than has ever existed in the history of the planet. A record that exists today so it can be broken tomorrow.

## **Wireless World**

The paradox of the Matrix is this: to be an ace hacker, you need to understand it – but no one really understands it. Like so many things, though, the real key is to know more and be better than the next guy. So, let’s get you started with a quick overview of the Matrix experience.

## **The Local Mesh**

This is the part of the Matrix that relies on device-to-device connections and is called the **local mesh** or sometimes the **lower grid**. The extreme density of devices in a 2075 city, combined with the ability to seamlessly pass traffic from device to device, can get your signal where it needs to go. The local mesh has a strictly limited range: too many hops, too much distance or too much interference and the signal degrades and becomes useless. Fortunately, for a legitimate user, their network traffic only needs to reach an **uplink node**, so this is rarely an issue. Any two or more Matrix devices within range of each other can form a local mesh, even if they cannot route a signal out to the wider Matrix. They will still be able to communicate with themselves as normal.

## **Uplink Nodes**

When you want to communicate with a device that’s outside local mesh range, first you need an **uplink node**. These are scattered around major metropolitan areas. Your device sends traffic along the local mesh until it reaches the nearest or most convenient uplink node. Uplinks serve as the onramps to the rest of the Matrix; they bridge your traffic over to the backbone. Uplink nodes are sometimes called beanstalks by deckers, because they lead to the clouds.

## **The Backbone**

The **backbone** or the **upper grid**, is the planet-sized interconnected network of fibre cables, satellites, microwave and visible-laser point-to-point communications and other bleeding-edge-tech ways of getting 1s and 0s from A to B. Once your traffic is on the backbone, distance is no object and bandwidth is functionally infinite. Security on uplink nodes is fierce and traffic on the backbone is routinely subjected to deep packet inspection.

## **Commlinks**

Commlinks are the most visible part of the Matrix – the device most commonly associated with it in people’s minds. They are analogous to modern-day smartphones and often take the form of a pocket-sized slab covered in a touchscreen (although they can be much smaller if the user forgoes the screen).

Most people using a commlink do so via a **direct neural interface** (DNI) and **augmented reality** (AR).

DNI gives the user a limited amount of mental control directly over the device, without needing to look at the device or push any buttons. DNI is not telepathy. The user can issue simple on/off, less/more, scroll up/down type commands but not much that is more complicated than that. They can also dictate text but only at the speed that is a few times faster than talking. DNI is tiring to use for long period, as it requires close concentration of a particular kind for the machine to detect the commands. It’s like maintaining a fully spoken inner monologue. Few people can keep that up all day long.

AR means the commlink’s output – mostly visual and audio, some tactile – is projected directly into the user’s consciousness. They see pop-up windows floating in their vision, hear sounds overlaid with the real world, feel the weight and texture of virtual “objects” they touch. Each distinct element of an augmented reality user interface is called an **augmented reality object** (ARO), pronounced “arrow”. AROs can come from your commlink itself, like a messaging window for a control palette. They can be broadcast from nearby devices, like a restaurant displaying a holographic menu outside its door or a friend showing you a selfie they took. Or they can be sent to you from items you are carrying, such as a smartgun displaying remaining ammunition count in a discreet window in the corner of your eye. Because pure DNI control requires mental effort, less hardcore users sometimes fall back to either physical controls or (more often) AROs displaying control surfaces. These are less tiring and can be more precise when very delicate control is needed. User interface AROs accessed via DNI have a tactile component, so the user feels like they are interacting with real physical objects that have weight, texture and temperature.

## **PANs**

Most individuals have multiple electronic devices on them at once and having icons for each one show up would provide too much visual clutter in the Matrix. Often, what shows up instead is an icon representing an individual’s personal area network. This icon often looks similar to the physical device that serves as master for the network, such as a commlink or cyberdeck, but individuals will sometimes choose a design or logo that means something to them (such as sports team logos, Concrete Dreams album covers or corporate designs). Some devices are not merged into the single **PAN** icon; if an individual is carrying a wireless-enabled gun – or another wireless device that might kill you – if may show up separately so that it can be identified rapidly. Unless, of course, the user has gone to the trouble to hide that icon, but that’ll be covered later.

Devices can be slaved to a commlink or cyberdeck. The group consisting of slaved devices plus the master commlink or cyberdeck is called a personal area network, or PAN.

## **WIRELESS DEVICES**

Wireless devices are rated for their power and efficiency based on a number of factors and well as having information about their current use status. Below are the ratings and statuses that a wireless device may have.

**Device Rating**: The device rating is a generic rating for standard devices that don’t have more detailed ratings listed.

**Response**: Response is the processing power and speed of the device’s hardware. Response is used for Matrix Initiative. Response is negatively affected when you run too many programs.

**Signal**: Signal represents the broadcasting power of the device’s hardware. The higher the Signal, the farther the device can transmit and the more signal-noise it can cut through.

**Firewall**: Firewall is the device’s built-in security software. It protects against unauthorised access and fends off hostile access attempts and exploits. Firewall is also used to defend against Matrix attacks in cybercombat.

**System**: System measures the power of the device’s operating system (OS) software. This includes its stability, multitasking properties, ability to control hardware, resources and the general quality of its code. If the System software ever crashes, the entire device crashes. System limits the rating of programs running on the device and sets the limit on most devices for the number of programs that can be run without a Response drop. The System program is limited by the base Response rating of the device it is on: if the base Response rating of the device is lower than the System rating, then the System rating runs equal to the Response rating. System also sets the size of the Matrix Condition Monitor of persona programs running on the device.

**Processor Limit**: Every device has a processor limit, the number of programs loaded and/or slaved devices at which its Response starts to degrade. At every multiple of the System beyond the initial Processor Limit, a device’s Response is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0.

**Active Programs**: The number of programs that can be run simultaneously.

**Device Modes**: Active, Passive and Hidden.

#### **User Modes Table**

|**User Mode**|**Initiative**|**Initiative Dice**|**Notes**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Augmented Reality**|Physical Initiative|Physical Initiative Dice|Can be distracting|
|**Cold-Sim**|Response + Intuition|3D6|-|
|**Hot-Sim**|Response + Intuition|4D6|+2 bonus to Matrix actions|

## **Matrix Condition Monitor**

The Matrix Condition Monitor measures the amount of Matrix damage an icon can take. It typically has a number of boxes equal to 8 + (System / 2, rounded up). An icon crashes when all the boxes on its Matrix Condition Monitor are filled. If your persona icon crashes, you are immediately disconnected from the Matrix, as with the Jack Out action. If you were operating in VR, you suffer dumpshock when this happens.

## **Noise**

Noise is the static of the wireless Matrix. There are a lot of things than can mess with your signal, like nearby electronics, natural and artificial dampening and even cosmic background radiation. It may seem as if traffic in the Matrix is instantaneous, but ask anyone who has played an online game with someone a few continents away – there is a noticeable delay when compared to playing someone next door. When decisions are being made in the blink of an eye, every speed difference matters. The farther you are away from an icon in real life, the harder it is to communicate with it, whether your intentions are harmful or benign.

The most common source of noise is distance from your target, but there are other causes. There are also spam zones and static zones to deal with. A spam zone has so much traffic (often commercial in nature) that everything gets processed slower. Static zones are areas with either a lot of electromagnetic blockage (like an underground tunnel, labyrinth of sewer or ruins of a steel office building) or far away from civilisation.

## **Signal Rating Table**

|**Rating**|**Range**|**Examples**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**0**|2 m|Nanoware transceivers, cyberware, intra-PAN devices|
|**1**|40 m|RFID tags, handheld electronics|
|**2**|100 m|Headware transceivers, micro-drone sensors|
|**3**|400 m|Average commlinks, residential/small business wi-fi routers, vehicular autonav sensors|
|**4**|1 km|Crawler-drone sensors|
|**5**|4 km|Cyberlimb transceivers, heavy drone surveillance sensors|
|**6**|10 km|Mobile-phone towers, public access wi-fi routers|
|**7**|40 km|Targeting sensors for ground vehicle weapons|
|**8**|100 km|Flight radar, dedicated ground surveillance radar|
|**9**|400 km|Maritime/naval radar, commercial AM/FM radio|

## **Device Modes**

Devices can run in one of three modes: Active, Passive and Hidden. You can change the mode of your commlink (and the rest of your PAN) as a Bonus Action.

**Active Mode**: Active mode is the default for most PANs. In Active mode, you can both access and be accessed by other PANs, devices and networks. You give permission for anyone to connect to your commlink and see your profile (read only, unless you choose otherwise). Certain areas may require your PAN to be in active mode, like airports, corp facilities, major metropolitan centres, etc. Your public profile is visible and available.

**Passive Mode**: A PAN in Passive mode can be “seen” by other devices, but cannot be accessed by them without your approval. PANs in this mode will still show up as active networks. This mode is useful for operating in high-traffic areas, where advertising nets or spammers abound. Passive mode allows you to automatically filter out the noise, only alerting you if specific pre-authorised nodes request access. This is the default mode for peripheral nodes and nexi.

**Hidden Mode**: In Hidden mode, your commlink and PAN are invisible to other nodes unless you access or authorise them. Users in hidden mode are said to be “ghosting”, since there is no way for other users to see them wirelessly. Using hidden mode is discouraged in some high-class social situations where it is considered rude. In other areas, particularly tech-free zones or shadow establishments where privacy is expected, the opposite is true. Certain secure areas and high-class establishments prohibit users from operating in hidden mode and will punish those doing so with expulsion, arrest or worse.

While in Hidden Mode, you suffer a -2 dice pool penalty on all Matrix actions due to the processing power needed to cover your tracks.

## **Matrix Actions for the Non-Hacker**

- **Log On**: Simple Action. No Test. You access a node and your icon (persona) appears there. This requires no test, as long as you have proper authentication to an account (such as a passcode) or a hacked account. It should go without saying, but you also need a connection to the node’s device, either with a wired connection or a wireless connection. You can’t log on if have no way to get online.

- **Switch to AR/VR**: Simple Action. You switch your perception from AR to VR or vice versa. Not that switching to VR causes your body to go limp, so do not do so in dangerous places. If you switch from VR to AR, you might lose Initiative.

- **Send Message**: Bonus Action. No Test. You send a text or audio message the length of a short sentence, an image or a file via the Matrix to a use whose commcode you have. If you’re using the Matrix through a DNI, you can send longer and more complicated messages. You can also use this action to open a live feed to one or more recipients, using and digital recording devices you have.

- **Matrix Search**: Extended Action.<span style="color: red;"> Computer + Intuition [Browse Program Rating] (\*)</span>. You search the Matrix for information about a topic. The time it takes and the threshold of the test depend on the general availability of the information in question and the area being searched, respectively. Any hits above and beyond the threshold can be used to reduce the search time. Divide the base time by the net hits to determine the reduction. If you fail this test, you still spend the full base time looking.

> Some information is protected and kept secret, stored in a host that is not publicly accessible. Finding this information usually requires you to find and enter the hosts in which the data is hidden.

- **Matrix Perception**: Simple Action. Computer + Intuition [Analyse Program Rating]. You hits determine how successful the examination is. If your target is running a Stealth program, it becomes an Opposed Test, with the target rolling Logic + Electronic Warfare (+Stealth program rating) (or Firewall + Stealth for devices or nodes) as the opposing dice pool. The hits from this test reduce your hits and consequently the amount of information you gather. If you garner no net hits, the target’s icon has melded into the background of data traffic, escaping your notice.

> You may also use Matrix Perception to determine whether someone has tapped Matrix traffic through the node or to detect some of the tricks that sprites can perform.

- **Control Device**: Complex Action. No Test. You control a device through the Matrix, using your Command Program like a remote control or video game controller. This can be used in a variety of ways from commanding your soykaf machine to start brewing a pot before you get out of bed to firing a drone-mounted rifle. The complexity of the device you can control and the complexity of the commands you send are limited by your Command program rating. In the hierarchy of control, this is Remote Control. If it isn’t your device, you need to gain access permissions first.

- **Run Program**: Complex Action. You run a program that is loaded in a device to which you have access and the appropriate privileges. This changes the program’s status from loaded to running. Programs must be running in order to be used.

- **Deactivate Program**: Simple Action. You switch a program’s status from running to loaded.

- **Edit File**: Variable Action. Computer + Logic [Edit Program Rating]. The threshold is based on the extent, quality and complexity of the edits being made. Continuous editing of a device’s output requires the expenditure of a Simple Action every Initiative Phase for the duration. Edit allows you to create, change or delete files. A Complex Action is required to alter one detail of a file: about a sentence of text or a detail of an image or about a second of video or audio.

- **Encrypt**: Complex Action. Software + Logic [Encrypt Program Rating]. You encrypt a file, set of files, node or communication link. You also choose a passcode that you or another user can use to decrypt the file.

- **Decrypt**: Complex Action. If you have the key to a particular encryption, you decrypt it with this action. If you use this on a file, the file becomes decrypted.

- **Transfer Data**: Simple Action. No Test. You transfer a file or set of files from one node to another. Most transfers last until the end of the current Combat Turn; the connection speeds of the Matrix are fast enough that only files of epic size take longer than normal.

- **Terminate Data Transfer**: Bonus Action. You terminate a data transfer you initiated.

- **Log Off**: Simple Action. You log off the node and close your connection to a host.

- **Reboot**: Complex Action. You initiate a reboot of a device you have appropriate privileges to do so (often an admin account). All programs stop running and all subscriptions are terminated and anyone who is still running their persona on the device is severed from the Matrix, suffering dumpshock if they are in VR.

## **DECKING**

A decker is someone who uses a cyberdeck (hence the name) to break the rules of the Matrix. A cyberdeck – usually just called a deck – is like a commlink with some extra features. It is a bit bigger than a commlink, about the size of a small tablet or a spiral-bound notebook. Its specialised functions are questionable legality make it far more expensive than ordinary commlinks. The cyberdeck has advanced electronics and firmware based on reverse-engineered protocols used in Matrix security. In a short, a cyberdeck is the tool you need to be a decker.

A deck can perform all the functions of a commlink, but its primary purpose is hacking in the Matrix. Cyberdecks have a built-in sim module because they are so often used in VR, so a decker only needs a datajack or other DNI device to make that connection, instead of needing the full sim implant.

Deckers are far and away the most common type of hacker. They come to a profession out of necessity, a desire for profit or a sense of mischief: or all three. They are heavily dependent on their skills and they need good gear to make sure their skills shine. They can usually maintain and even build their own electronic devices.

### **Matrix Actions for the Decker**

**Masked Access**: Complex Action. Hacking + Logic [Exploit Program Rating] v Intuition + Firewall. You falsify account details to log on without real access permissions. You access a node and your icon (persona) appears there. On a failure, the target’s alert level is raised and you are spotted.

**Force Access**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Exploit Program Rating] v Willpower + Firewall. You make a brute force attack to log on without real access permissions. You access a node and your icon (persona) appears there. The target’s alert level is raised and you are spotted. If you wish, you may also inflict 1 DV of Matrix damage to the target for every two full net hits, if the target can take Matrix damage, which is resisted with the target’s Device Rating + Firewall. On a failure, you don’t alert them at all.

**Intercept Traffic**: Complex Action. Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Snoop Program Rating] (3). You eavesdrop traffic between two nodes. To do this, you must have access to a node through which the traffic passes. This action is only effective in a wired network. Your net hits are the threshold for others to detect the snooping with a Matrix Perception Test. The traffic may be copied and recorded or forwarded to a third part with no additional tests.

If the traffic is encrypted, you must break the encryption before it can be examined. Once decrypted, if you want to block or alter some of the traffic before sending it along, you must use the Edit action.

To insert fake traffic, you must succeed in an Opposed Test between the Hacking + Logic [Snoop Program Rating] v System + Firewall.

**Squelch**: Simple Action. Electronic Warfare + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Stealth + Intuition. A successful Squelch test prevents the target device from calling or sending messages for a number of Combat Turns equal to the net hits scored.

**Intercept Wireless Comms**: Complex Action. Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Snoop Program Rating] (3). You eavesdrop on wireless traffic going to and from a device. You must be within the device’s Signal range to capture the traffic. If you succeed on the test, you may copy, record or forward the traffic without another test as long as you remain within the target device’s Signal range and keep the program running. If the comms are encrypted, you must break the encryption before they can be examined.

**Crack Encryption**: Extended Action. Hacking + Logic [Decrypt Program Rating] (Encryption Rating, Variable). You attempt to break down an encryption to which you have access. When you break the encryption, the data becomes decrypted.

**Corrupt Data**: Extended Action. Hacking + Logic [Corrupt Program Rating] (Variable, Complex Action). The Corrupt Data action unleashes a Corrupt program on a particular file. The program is set to twist and change information. The threshold is based on the complexity of the data, the size of the file and the abundance of the data.

**Spoof Command**: Complex Action. Hacking + Logic [Spoof Program Rating]. You send a command to a device or agent, pretending it is from an authorised source. You must have logged on to a device from which the target accepts commands. If you succeed, the target accepts the command as legitimate. Each Spoof Command action applies only to a single command; multiple commands require multiple Spoof Command attempts. In the hierarchy of control, this is a command to the Autopilot.

**Trace Icon**: Extended Action. Computer + Intuition [Track Program Rating] (10, Complex Action). You trace an icon back to its originating node. When you reach the threshold of the Extended Test, you have successfully traced the target, learning the target’s access ID and the physical location of the device housing the originating node (for example, the user’s commlink). As long as you keep your Track program running and the target remains connected to the Matrix, you may continue to monitor the target’s location.

**Redirect Trace**: Complex Action. Hacking + Intuition [Spoof Program Rating]. The number of net hits are added to the threshold of the Trace Icon Test. You may take this action multiple times against the same target. This action only works against a tracking attempt in progress.

**Jack Out**: Simple Action. You disconnect from your device. In VR, it means removing your connection from your commlink, either by removing trodes, unplugging a datajack or shutting off a neural connection. If you jack out while in VR, you suffer dumpshock.

Note: If you are link-locked, this requires a Hardware + Willpower [Firewall] with a threshold of twice the net hits on the Link-Lock Test.

### **Matrix Combat Actions**

**Attack Device**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Firewall + Firewall [Firewall]. You make an attack against a device in a node where your persona currently exists. If you score more hits that the defender, the attack succeeds – not the net hits. Otherwise, the attack fails.

**Attack Persona**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Intuition + Firewall [Firewall]. You make an attack against a persona in a node where your persona currently exists. If you score more hits that the defender, the attack succeeds – not the net hits. Otherwise, the attack fails.

**Crash Program**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Program Rating + Firewall [Firewall]. You make an attack against a program in a node where your persona currently exists.

**Link-Lock**: Complex Action. Computer + Logic [Lockdown Program Rating] v Intuition + Firewall [Firewall]. This program sends keep-alive signals to the device that force it to cancel any attempt to leave the Matrix. You prevent a persona from being able to switch interface mode, enter or exit the node, reboot their device or log off until you stop running the Lockdown program or they successfully Jack Out. The net hits become the threshold for Jacking Out.

**Repair Icon**: Extended Action. Software + Logic [Medic Program Rating] (Damage Taken x2, Complex Action). When the threshold is reached, all damage is removed from the target icon. Note that it is possible for the threshold to change during the Extended Test if the icon suffers further damage. This action only repairs Matrix Damage.

### **Programs**

In order to interact with the Matrix, you need to use programs. Programs can be purchased (or written by a hacker) and then stored with a cyberdeck or commlink. A program that is stored is loaded into the device. This is analogous to wearing a holstered weapon or putting a tool in your pocket; a loaded program is being carried for later use.

In order to use a program, it must be running. A running program is executed by the device on which your persona is running and belongs to your persona; only you may use the program.

### **Common Use Programs**

Common use programs are widespread and legal throughout the Matrix.

**Analyse**: Analyse programs gather data about icons and nodes in the Matrix by issuing queries, analysing system resources, performing registry lookups and so on.

*This program, when active, enables the Matrix Perception action.*

**Browse**: Browse programs are specialised search routines that help track down information on a particular node or in the Matrix at large.

*This program, when active, enables the Matrix Search action.*

**Command**: Command programs give the user a modular and customisable control interface for various devices. The allows the user to control a device through the Matrix.

*This program, when active, enables the Control Device action.*

**Edit**: Edit is a combination word processor, graphic design tool and video/animation editor. You can use it to create and alter files of any media type: text, graphics, video, trideo, simsense, etc. Edit sees common usage in the corporate world but hackers use it for their own subversive ends.

*This program, when active, enables the Edit File action.*

### **Hacking Programs**

The following programs are generally only used by hackers and security specialists. In most jurisdictions, these programs are illegal without proper licencing. Hackers use these programs to exploit security flaws and attack icons.

**Armour**: Armour programs are software redundancy and automatic backup systems that protect personas from attacks that cause Matrix Damage.

*This program, when active, adds the Armour Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Damage.*

**Attack**: Attack programs are hostile code carriers that attempt to kill processes, introduce random input, create program faults and otherwise try to crash a program, persona or device.

*This program, when active, enables the Attack Device, Attack Persona and Crash Program action.*

**Biofeedback Filter**: Biofeedback filters are software routines that monitor simsense signals and filter harmful feedback. Hackers specifically use biofeedback filters against attack programs in cybercombat and against dumpshock.

*This program, when active, adds the Biofeedback Filter Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Biofeedback Damage and Dumpshock Damage.*

**Corrupt**: A mix of Edit and Browse subroutines, Corrupt programs are designed to track down and demolish specific information in a node without actually deleting the files in which they are saved. The idea is that, since deleted files can be restored from back-ups, Corrupt edits the files to overwrite the targeted information while leaving the file intact, without making any indication of the alteration, so that the corrupted file is eventually backed up as well, making detection and recovery of the original more difficult.

*This program, when active, enables the Corrupt Data action.*

**Decrypt**: Decrypt programs are designed to conduct a number of cipher-busting attacks – from pattern analysis to brute-force dictionary assaults to sophisticated mathematical tricks – to break into an encrypted system or service.

*This program, when active, enables the Crack File Protection action.*

**Evade**: Evasion programs hinder attack programs from successfully affecting your persona.

*This program, when active, adds the Evasion Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Attacks.*

**Exploit**: Exploit programs are constantly evolving hacker tools specifically designed to take advantage of security flaws and weaknesses so that a hacker can gain unauthorised access to a node or program.

*This program, when active, enables the Masked Access action.*

**Lockdown**: The lockdown program is used to link-lock a persona until you stop running this program or they successfully Jack Out.

*This program, when active, enables the Link-Lock action.*

**Medic**: Use Medic programs to repair Matrix damage inflicted on Personas and Devices. Though legitimate users sometimes use Medic programs to fix corrupted files, misbehaving programs and other errors, hackers use Medic to keep functioning after a bout of cybercombat.

*This program, when active, enables the Repair Icon action.*

**Snoop**: Snoop programs gather data traffic and wireless signals and capture the information. Snoop programs are the ultimate Matrix spying utility.

*This program when active, enables the Intercept Wireless Comms and Intercept Traffic actions.*

**Spoof**: You can use Spoof programs to generate false access IDs and forge misleading data packets with the intent of confusing Track programs.

*This program, when active, enables the Redirect Trace and Spoof Command actions.*

**Stealth**: Stealth is a clever hacker program that attempts to hide the hacker from other system processes. While it cannot make an icon completely undetectable, it makes the hacker seem innocuous by obfuscating their activities, erasing system tracks and mimicking authorised traffic. While it is not used for any action, Stealth hides the hacker from detection by the Firewall as they break into a system, as well as from Matrix Perception tests and Trace User attempts.

*This program, when active, adds the Stealth Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Perception.*

**Track**: Track programs systematically analyse a user’s connection and follow the data trail back to the originating node. Track is commonly used as an intrusion countermeasure with the intent of identifying and locating a hacker or launching a counterattack, but it is also used to keep tabs on automated taxis and emergency service calls.

*This program, when active, enables the Trace Icon action and adds the Track Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed Matrix Perception Tests made to detect personas.*

**<a name="_toc218024811"></a>RIGGING**\

=======================================

### **Being the Machine**

Rigging starts with the important first step of having a control rig augmentation for your character. That’s only the starting point, though – there’s a lot more to being a rigger than just having a rig. Like everything on the street, it’s also about your skills. And then, the most SOTA rig and the best skills still won’t mean squat without something to take control of and that means a vehicle or a drone. Or several drones, in which case you’re going to want a rigger command console (RCC). No one ever said being this cool was gonna be cheap.

Every control rig needs a rigger interface. The rigger interface is specialised gear that is fitted to a vehicle and allows you to jump in, rigger-style. Drones are designed for use by riggers and have been designed with the rigger interface built in. Nearly all vehicles need to have the interface added as an after-factory option, however, except for military and law-enforcement vehicles.

### **The Control Rig**

The control rig implant connects to a lot of different areas of your brain. It uses your motor cortex, of course, along with parts of your cerebrum, brain stem and the sensorium, with a few tendrils snaking around your pre-frontal and frontal cortices. A control rig is required for rigging.

### **Complete Control**

Vehicles and other devices (like doors, trid-sets and so on) can be controlled in four ways.

- - Autopilot requires that the device have a pilot program, which most vehicles and drones do.
- - Manual control requires actual physical controls, like a steering wheel, throttle, buttons, an AR display or anything else a person can manipulate to control the device.
- - Remote control is the result of the Control Device action
- - Rigger control is the result of jumping into the device.

### **Control Override**

A device can only be controlled one way at a time. You can’t, for example, have a person manually firing a turret at the same time you’re firing the same turret to get extra shots. Some control methods can be overridden by other methods and the highest in this order controls the device. At the top of the order is rigger control, followed by remote control, then manual control and lastly autopilot. You can override someone else’s control on a device by using a method that comes in higher on that list, so if you issue a command through a control rig, attempts to manoeuvre at the same time using a remote control or manual control will be overridden. Once a device’s control is overridden, it cannot be controlled by a method equal to or lower that it in the order until the Initiative Pass after the current controller relinquishes control (voluntarily… or not).

### **Rigging and You**

Riggers have a special set of rules when they’re jumped in. This makes them more powerful, but also exposes them to more risks. Here’s the skinny on all of the specialness you’ll have as a rigger in the Sixth World.

### **Rigging Security Systems**

It is possible for the devices in a security system (cameras, maglocked doors, laser tripwires, fixed gun-drones and other sensors and sec-measures) to be rigger adapted and subscribed to a central node so that a rigger can “jump in” the entire security system. Security riggers feel the opening of doors as light touches on their skin, the tripping of alarm sensors as a buzz in their fingers or an itch and the building’s alarm literally goes off in their heads.

### **Jumping In**

**Direct Connection**: A direct connection requires you have a control rig and device (vehicle, security system, drone) that has a rigger interface.

If you’re using a direct connection and already plugged into the vehicle or RCC, you can jump in from your meat body with a Simple Action. If you’re using a direct connection, you don’t have to worry about Noise at all. A rigger’s data cable gets a lot of use for this reason. When jumped in, you’re in VR mode.

**Jump Into Rigged Device**: Simple Action if using a direction connection. Otherwise, Complex Action. Electronic Warfare + Logic [Command] v Willpower + Firewall [Firewall]. You jump into a device that has a rigger adaptation, usually a vehicle, drone or security system. This action requires that you have a control rig and to be in VR mode. Additionally, you must have the appropriate access level to the device (whether through ownership, invite or hacking).

**VR and Rigging**: Just like in the Matrix, you have the option of using cold-sim or hot-sim while rigging. If you’re using cold-sim, you get +2D6 to your Initiative (3D6 total) and any biofeedback damage you take is Stun. If you’re using hot-sim, you get +3D6 (4D6 total) Initiative dice and a +1 dice pool bonus that applies to all Matrix tests (including Vehicle actions), but all biofeedback damage is Physical damage.

**Rigging Limits**: When you’re jumped into a vehicle, drone or other device, the limits of that device are increased by the rating of your control rig. This includes vehicle and drone Sensor, Acceleration and Handling and the Accuracy of mounted weapons when used by the rigger.

**Physical Damage**: Whenever the vehicle or other device you’re jumped into takes Physical damage, the feedback can hurt you. Whenever the vehicle or drone you’re jumped into takes boxes of damage, you must resist half (rounded up) of that damage as Biofeedback damage.

If the vehicle, drone or device you’re jumped into is destroyed while you’re jumped in, you suffer dump shock (6 DV biofeedback damage).

**Matrix Damage**: When you take Matrix damage, it goes to the first device you’re using for your persona, not the device you’re jumped into. If you used your commlink or rigger command console to enter VR before jumping in, your commlink or RCC (respectively) is the target of Matrix damage to your persona.

### **Jumping Out**

**Jump to VR**: You can jump out of a device and go to VR as a Simple Action.

**Jump to AR**: You can jump out of a device and go to AR as a Complex Action.

### **Rigger Command Console (RCC)**

Along with the standard features of a commlink, rigger command consoles have Noise Reduction and Sharing Ratings. The Noise Reduction rating is straight-up Noise Reduction, which is cumulative with most other forms of Noise Reduction. The Sharing Rating is the number of autosofts you can run on the RCC that simultaneously run on all slaved devices at the same time. One caveat: if a system is running any of its own autosofts, it cannot benefit from the RCC’s autosofts.

Rigger command consoles have the familiar Response, Signal, System and Firewall ratings, similar to cyberdecks, but they lean towards boosted Signal and System Ratings in their functionality. Firewall is used to defend against unwanted wireless intrusion onto the entire system network.

Your RCC manages several parallel connections at once, so you can give a command to one, all or some of your slaved devices with the same Simple Action. This multi-connection also lets you jump from one slaved device to another without first jumping out of the device you’re leaving. Commands issued from your RCC are acted on during your device’s Action Phase, not yours.

Devices receiving multiple contradicting commands on the same control levels before they have a chance to enact those commands on their Action Phase tend to fail to perform any of them and instead send an error message back to the users attempting to issue the commands.

### **PANs & WANs**

If you want extra protection for your devices and ability to command groups of the same type at once, you must slave them to your RCC. Your RCC can handle up to (System x3) slaved devices, becoming the master device on that network. The group of your slaved devices plus your master RCC is called a **personal area network** or PAN.

Whenever a slaved device needs to make a Defence Test, it uses either its own or its master’s Rating for each Rating in the Test.

There are also **wide area networks** or WANs, with multiple devices slaved to a host. This is the world of that special kind or rigger, the security spider. They slave their RCC to the building’s host and connect to the entire security system, including all of its slaved drones. The spider-rigger is often teamed up with a spider-decker to help against hacking intrusions on the security system.

**<a name="_toc218024812"></a>DRONES**\

======================================
Drones are unmanned vehicles intended to be used remotely by riggers or run autonomously. Of course, any vehicle or other machine with a rigger interface can be run remotely by riggers or autonomously, but drones tend to be cheaper, more specialised to their function and don’t need to pay for parking. Still, the rules for drones apply to any remotely controlled or rigged device but, between us chummers, let’s just say “drone” because it’s shorter.

### **Drones in the Matrix**

Drones are devices, so they show up in the Matrix. This can make them a target for enemy hackers but it also means you can reach your drone from anywhere on the planet. If you’re jumped into a drone, the drone’s Matrix icon and your device’s icon merge. When jumped into a drone (or any vehicle for that matter) the attacker can only target you (your persona and the device it’s on) and not your drone. When you’re not jumped in, you drone becomes a valid target once again.

The default Device Rating of a drone is the same as its Pilot Rating.

**Drone Initiative**: Drones acting autonomously have an Initiative attribute of Device Rating x2 and get a total of 4D6 Initiative Dice. When jumped in, the drone uses the VR initiative of the rigger.

**Drone Perception**: A drone observes its surroundings with a Pilot + Clearsight [Sensor] Test. If you’re jumped into the drone, you make a Perception + Intuition [Sensor] Test. Either way, you get to use the drone’s entire sensor suite, if it has one.

**Drone Infiltration**: Drones sometimes need to be sneaky. When this occurs, a few things need to be taken into consideration. When operating independently, drones roll Pilot + Stealth [Handling] v Perception + Intuition [Mental]. You might want to put your drone into **Hidden Mode** or its Matrix icon would be a dead giveaway of their presence to anyone scanning the scene in the Matrix. When jumped in, the test is Stealth + Intuition [Handling] v Perception + Intuition [Mental]; you probably want your persona operating under **Hidden Mode** while you’re at it.

### **Pilot Programs**

Pilots (the programs, not the people) are not bright. They’re called “dog-brains” by those who have to work with them, much the same way a particularly thick person might be called a “drone-head” by those who work with them.

A pilot program is specific to the device it’s in. You can’t just copy a program from one device and move it into a different one. After a week or so, the pilot is so adapted to the specific vehicle, drone or other device that it’s useless in anything else, even other devices of the same model.

The Pilot Rating is used in place of any Mental attribute needed for a test but it hardly makes up for a metahuman brain. When faced with something novel or unexpected or a complicated command, a Pilot program must make a Pilot Rating x2 Test against a threshold set up the gamesmaster based on how confusing the situation is. If it fails this test, it blithely continues doing what it was doing before or simply stops entirely and asks for instructions.

### **Autosofts**

Autosofts are specialised programs designed to increase the effectiveness of a drone’s performance. In other words, people have skills, drones have autosofts. An autosoft is rated between 1 and 6. A drone has a number of slots to use for autosofts and cyberprograms listed on their profile. Swapping autosofts and programs is a Complex Matrix Action.

Here’s a short list of autosoft programs. An autosoft with the term [Model] in it means that each copy is for a specific model of drone or vehicle.

**[Model] Clearsight**: This acts as the drone’s Perception skill.

**Electronic Warfare**: Exactly like the Electronic Warfare skill.

**[Model] Evasion**: This autosoft teaches the drones autopilot how to avoid being locked onto by Sensors.

**[Model] Manoeuvring**: This is like a Pilot [Vehicle type] skill, except that it only applies to one specific drone model.

**[Model]** **Stealth**: This autosoft helps a drone of a specific model operate with as much stealth as possible and acts as the Sneaking skill for the drone.

**[Weapon] Targeting**: This is the Gunnery skill but for a weapon of a specific model. If you mount an Ingram Smartgun, you’ll need an Ingram Smartgun Targeting autosoft for it.

If a drone is slaved to a rigger command console and isn’t running any of its own programs, it uses the programs running on the RCC. This can exceed its normal program limit.

**<a name="_toc218024813"></a>TECHNOMANCERS**\

=============================================
Technomancers are metahumans with the mysterious (if not mystical) ability to connect to and manipulate the Matrix without the aid of technology. They not only have this seemingly supernatural aptitude, but they have the ability to do things that no computer can do or *should* be able to do. Scientists and magical researchers haven’t figured out what makes a technomancer tick, but they agree that it isn’t science or magic. As you’d suspect, this makes a lot of people very nervous around technomancers. The fact that a lot of people believe that it might be fun for researchers to cut open a technomancer’s brain to see how it works tends to make technomancers nervous around other people, especially megacorporate Matrix engineers.

Technomancers live in a world filled with the ebb and flow of data. They feel datastreams and empathise with icons. The Matrix is just part of the world they live in, as natural for them as walking is for mundane folks. Even technomancers don’t really know how they do it – they just do it.

With their intuitive grasp of computers and the Matrix, almost all technomancers are wiz programmers. Most employers won’t hire them, though, because the world just doesn’t trust technomancers. In the public view, technomancers are creepy and unnatural. They communicate through the Matrix (*subverting* it, they say) with a thought, so suspicions of a global conspiracy abound. Whenever something goes wrong in the Matrix, especially if there are fatalities, the spectre of the technomancer menace rises again in the media and news outlets. There is still a bounty on technomancers in some territories and technomancy is punishable by death in a handful of places around the world. The end result of this is that technomancers hide their abilities and identities and some even their talent with programming, to avoid harassment and threats.

This is not to say that all technomancers are bad or out to twist the Matrix to their own ends. Most just want to live their lives in peace. Very few are actually hackers and only a few of those are talented enough to be shadowrunners.

### **Technomancer Life**

While deckers might be thought of as scuba divers, using all sorts of gear to dive into and navigate the Matrix, technomancers are more like squid. The Matrix is their native environment and they use it reflexively and instinctually. They don’t have to make sure they’ve got the right gear on them, that it’s turn on, connected and functioning optimally. They want to do something, they dive into the streams surrounding them and do it.

Technomancers pick up the skills to deal with both the physical world and the data that’s constantly flowing through the air around them. They learn how to keep from being overwhelmed in high-traffic areas and how to keep from being withdrawn or depressed in static zones or places with weak coverage. They learn how to make their brains their own operating system and browser combined, an access point they can use to find what they want, all while keeping everything else from getting in and bludgeoning their brains with song lyrics, stock quotes and celebrity gossip. And two million videos of kittens.

What their brains do – and plenty of researchers would love to know how this works – is learn the basic Matrix protocols, so that they can see the icons of the Matrix the way gear-based users see them. It’s like learning a language for them, and once they know it, technomancers have trouble imagining a world without that virtual vocabulary. It lets them see the icons and AROs laid over the world around them and allows them to drop into the trance that is the technomancer version of VR.

Most technomancers say the VR feels more comfortable to them, more “real”. They say that the hard, unmalleable reality of meatspace feels foreign to them. They prefer to be surrounded by things that respond to their desires and commands, things that are reactive and alive with information, not dead and inert like real-world objects.

Technomancers tend to be fluid thinkers, talented analysts or virtuoso programmers. While deckers work with gear, starting with the tool and producing a result, technomancers start with their desire and then devise or summon tools that allow them to do it. They can be very fast, creative and unpredictable. Most non-technomancers find it best to either to have one on their side or never to meet one at all.

### **Resonance**

The **Resonance** is what technomancers use to describe the energy that they feel and manipulate in the Matrix. It consists of data, interactions between data streams, intentions, thoughts… okay, nobody really knows what it’s made of, but to technomancers it’s a real thing they can feel and touch.

If you’re a technomancer, you have a Resonance attribute. This attribute represents how connected you are to the Resonance. Your Resonance rating affects all of your Resonance abilities and your living persona. Your natural Resonance maximum is your Essence rounded down. For every point (or faction thereof) of Essence lost, both your current Resonance Attribute and your maximum Resonance Rating are reduced by one. If your Resonance ever reaches zero, you lose the Technomancer quality and all Resonance abilities.

**Resonance Signatures**: When you use a Resonance ability, you leave a unique signature behind in the fabric of the Resonance. This Resonance signature gets left on the target. If you’re in a host, your signature is left there, too. A signature has a rating equal to the Resonance rating of whatever left it and it lasts for one hour times its rating.

Other Resonance beings (technomancers, sprites and… others) can detect a Resonance signature by getting at least 3 hits on a Matrix Perception Test. If you’ve seen a signature before you may recognise it (perhaps requiring a Memory Test). With 5 or more hits, you also get the impression of what kind of being or ability left it there. You can erase a signature with the Erase Signature action.

Resonance beings have their own signatures (with a rating equal to their Resonance) on themselves all the time. A sprite has the resonance signature of the technomancer that complied it, as do the signatures the sprite leaves.

**Erase Resonance Signature**: Complex Action

**Test**: Computer + Resonance [Resonance] v (2x Signature Rating)

You temporarily conceal the personal signature on yourself (or your sprite) for 1 Combat Turn per hit.

### **Resonance Actions**

Some actions you can perform as a technomancer are Resonance actions. These actions only operate in the Matrix but they’re not Matrix actions and don’t follow those rules. The bad news is that you don’t get the bonus dice for being in VR (those only come with Matrix Actions). Almost all Resonance action cause **fading**, a mental drain on the technomancer.

### **Fading**

Technomancers are powerful, but not inexhaustible. Resonance abilities strain the user, even to the point of collapse if they’re used too much. Technomancers call this drain **Fading**. Fading is resisted with Resonance + Willpower. Fading can only be healed by the body’s natural healing process, which means taking some time to rest.

### **Living Persona**

Technomancers have a **living persona** they use in the Matrix. Your living persona’s icon can be whatever you like, following the rules for persona icons. Since your living persona is just a persona, not a device, you don’t have any onboard storage; this is easy enough to deal with because you can store files in nearby devices.

Your Resonance is your Limit on your Resonance Actions. Your Response attribute is equal to your Intuition. Your Signal attribute is equal to your Charisma. Your System attribute is equal to your Logic. Your Firewall attribute is equal to your Willpower.

As a technomancer, you can only use AR and hot-sim VR (the only time you can use cold-sim VR is by using a cyberdeck or commlink – eww). Since you’re in hot-sim naturally, you may add your Resonance to your dice pool for all Addiction Tests for using hot-sim. Since you’re so intimately connected to the Matrix, you get a +2 dice pool bonus to all Matrix Perception Tests.

You don’t have a separate Matrix Condition Monitor. Instead, any boxes of Matrix damage you would take hit you directly as Stun damage.

**Rebooting Your Living Persona**: You can reboot your living persona, if you want. Really, you’re just shutting yourself off from the Matrix for a time but it operates with the same mechanics as the Reboot Device action (although it doesn’t count as a Matrix action). A lot of technomancers reboot their living persona before they go to sleep, using the reboot delay as a sort of built-in alarm clock; it keeps them safe from cyber-attacks while digital sugarplums dance in their heads.

**Using Mundane Electronics**: You can use a commlink or cyberdeck if you like. A lot of technomancers do in order to hide their abilities. If you use a persona on a device, you can’t use your Resonance abilities. That only works when you’re using your living persona, and since you can only use one persona at a time – well, you get the idea.

### **Threading**

If you ask different technomancers how they perform the Matrix miracles they do, they’ll tell you it’s called **threading** but they won’t agree on how it works. For some it’s a mental exercise. Others just ask the Matrix nicely to do what they want and still others think about different urban brawl plays. However it’s done, it gets results.

You can thread a **complex form**, a specific effect on the Matrix that you have learned to perform. Threading is accomplished with Thread Complex Form, a Resonance action (not a Matrix action). When you thread a complex form, you choose a **level** for the effect. The higher the **level**, the stronger the effect, but also the more risky it is to do. You can choose a **level** up to three times your Resonance rating.

### **Complex Forms**

Threading each Complex Form is a Complex Action.

**Editor**: Target: File Duration: P FV: L-1

You infuse a file with Resonance long enough to manipulate its contents. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] test against the Intuition + System of the file’s owner. You can make the same amount of changes to the file that you would be able to make with your net hits in Edit File actions.

**IC Tray**: Target: Host Duration: I FV: L-2

This complex form scans the host the technomancer is currently residing in and displays a list of the IC it is currently equipped to deploy, up to the number of hits scored on an Opposed Software + Resonance [Level] v Host Rating + Firewall Test.

**Pulse Storm**: Target: Persona Duration: I FV: L-3

You pull signals out of the Resonance and surround the target with them. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] test against Logic + System. For each net hit you get, the target’s Noise is increased by 1 until they reset their device.

**Puppeteer**: Target: Device Duration: I FV: L+1

You push Resonance commands into a target, forcing it to perform a Matrix Action. Pick a target and a Matrix Action for it to perform. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] against Willpower + Firewall Test with a threshold based on the type of action: 1 for a Bonus Action, 2 for Simple and 3 for Complex. If you succeed, the device performs that Matrix action.

**Redundancy**: Target: Device Duration: S FV: L+0

This form works with Resonance threads to better allow for secondary and tertiary connections, making the device slightly tougher for a limited amount of time. Redundancy grants additional, temporary boxes to the Matrix Damage Track of one device, giving a number of boxes equal to the hits acquired on a Simple Software + Resonance [Level] Test.

**Resonance Cache**: Target: IC Duration: I FV: L-2

The technomancer pushes a single IC into a stream of Resonance that isolates it, effectively locking it away. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] v Host Rating x2 opposed test. On a successful Test, the IC is locked in a Resonance fold for a number of combat turns equal to the complex form’s level.

**Resonance Channel**: Target: Device Duration: S FV: L-3

Instead of using Matrix channels, you communicate through a Resonance channel. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] Test. For each net hit, reduce the noise due to distance from the target device by 1.

**Resonance Spike**: Target: Device Duration: I FV: L-3

You send a spike of raw destructive Resonance into the target, causing errors and mayhem. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] v Willpower + Firewall Test. Your target takes 1 box of Matrix damage per net hit, with no chance to resist.

**Static Veil**: Target: Persona Duration: S FV: L-3

Resonance energy coils around you, hiding you from others. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] Test as a Complex Action. Add each hit as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Perception.

**Stitches**: Target: Sprite Duration: P FV: L-3

You knit the Resonance patterns in a sprite back together. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] Test as a Simple Action. For each hit, remove 1 box of Matrix damage from the target sprite.

**Tattletale**: Target: Persona Duration: P FV: L-3

The Resonance can be used to mimic the telltale signs of illegal activity in the Matrix – to your target’s sorrow. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] test. For each hit, increase the alarm level by 1.

### **Sprites**

Sprites are digital creatures formed out of (or summoned from, depending on who you ask) the Resonance. Sprites are then placed in the Matrix, personas without devices. Sprites are obedient and semi-autonomous but not very bright. Depending on their personality, a technomancer might think of a sprite as a tool, a program, a pet, a friend or a spirit of the machine. When a sprite’s code is analysed, it looks like a kludgy mish-mash of code snippets and junk data that shouldn’t work but does.

Sprites bend the rules of the Matrix just by existing. The Matrix isn’t really sure what to do with a sprite.

A sprite’s owner is the technomancer that compiled it and when you compile a sprite it has your Resonance signature. If its physical location is tracked, the tracker gets your physical location instead.

Sprites have a Device Rating and Resonance equal to their level and all four Matrix attributes are based on their level and the type of sprite you compile. Its Matrix Condition Monitor has 8 + (Level /2) boxes. A sprite’s initiative is also based on its Level and it has 4d6 initiative dice.

### **Sprite Actions**

**Command Spite**: Simple Action

You command a sprite to do something for you, using up one of its tasks.

**Call/Dismiss Sprite**: Simple Action

You call a registered sprite you have waiting in the Resonance, which appears at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. You can also use this action to send a sprite back to the Resonance, releasing it from any tasks it still owes you, which it does on its next action.

**Compile Sprite**: Complex Action

**Test**: Compiling + Resonance [Level] v Sprite Level

You compile a sprite.

**Decompile Sprite**: Complex Action

**Test**: Decompiling + Resonance [Level] v Sprite Level

You attempt to decompile a sprite.

**Register Sprite**: Complex Action

**Test**: Registering + Resonance [Level] v Sprite Level

You register a sprite.

### **Compiling a Sprite**

Bringing a sprite into the Matrix to work for you is called compiling. When you compile a sprite, you choose a Level for the sprite, up to twice your Resonance rating. The higher the Level, the more powerful the sprite. For every net hit on the Compile Sprite Test, you get one task from the sprite. You can spend one of these tasks having the sprite do one of the things on the list of complied sprite tasks.

Compiling sprites causes Fading of 2 DV per hit (not net hit) it gets in its defence test, with a minimum of 2 DV. This Fading is Stun damage, unless the sprite’s Level is greater than your Resonance, in which case it’s Physical damage. You can only have one compiled sprite at any given time.

### **Registered Sprite Tasks**

A task is basically one job you ask/tell your sprite to do. It has to be a simple task without conditions or heavy decision-making requirements.

**Use Sprite Power**: A single use of a sprite power.

**Matrix Actions**: One Combat Turn worth of Matrix Actions that apply to the same job.

**Combat**: Participation in cybercombat that lasts until all of the enemy combatants have been defeated or you’re escaped to safety.

**Sustain Power**: If a sprite uses a sustained power for you, sustaining that power doesn’t count against further tasks unless you change it in some way, like switching targets.

**Remote Task**: You can send a sprite to perform a remote task on another grid or in a host that you’re not in. When you send a sprite on a remote task, it vanishes back to the Resonance when it’s done and you lose any remaining tasks.

### **Registering a Sprite**

The Matrix doesn’t know what to make of sprites, so they show us as illegal activity.

You can increase your sprite’s “legitimacy” by registering them with the Matrix. This process takes a number of hours equal to the sprite’s Level; during this time neither you nor the sprite can take other actions. At the end of this time, make an Opposed Registering + Resonance [Level] v the sprite’s level x2. This causes Fading of 2 DV per hit (not net hit) the sprite gets, minimum 2 DV.

If you get at least one net hit, your sprite is registered with the Matrix. Add your net hits on the Registering test to the number of tasks your sprite owes you. The sprite is now a registered sprite and no longer counts toward your limit of one compiled sprite at a time. You can register a number of sprites equal to or less than your Charisma attribute.

### **Registered Sprite Tasks**

If you have a registered sprite, there is a special list of tasks you can have it do for you.

**Compiled Sprite Task**: A registered sprite can do anything a compiled sprite can do for you.

**Aid Study**: For the cost of one task, your registered sprite can give you a bonus equal to its Level to your dice pool when learning new complex forms. It costs one task per new complex form.

**Assist Threading**: Your registered sprite can add its Level to your dice pool to thread a complex form. This bonus lasts for one test.

**Loaned Task**: You can tell your registered sprite to follow the orders of another persona, even if that persona isn’t a technomancer. You get to pick how many tasks you’re loaning out. You don’t get to pick what those tasks will be, or what they can’t be, so make sure you trust whoever you loan your sprite to.

**Remote Task**: If send a registered sprite on a remote task, it doesn’t return to the Resonance when it’s done. Instead, it comes back to you.

**Re-register Sprite**: You can attempt to re-register the sprite for one task. If you use the sprite’s last task to do this, don’t screw up. If you succeed, add your net hits to the number of tasks the sprite owes you (minus the one for re-registering, of course). If you fail, you’re out of tasks, plain and simple.

**Standby**: You can tell your registered sprite to return to the Resonance but come when you call it. This costs a task but it keeps the sprite from giving away your presence or getting in harm’s way.

**Sustain Complex Form**: A registered sprite can sustain a complex form for you, so it takes the penalty from sustaining instead of you. Every task you use for this purpose lets the sprite sustain your complex form for up to its Level in Combat Turns. You can then take over sustaining again if you want.

### **Sprite-Technomancer Link**

You have a mental link to your sprites as long as you’re connected to the Matrix. You can communicate through this link with text, images, words and so on. If you lose your connection with the Matrix, you also lose your mental link with your sprite(s). They’ll keep working on whatever it is they were doing, but when they’re done they’ll either vanish or, if they’re registered, they’ll hang around waiting for you. Once you’re back online, you link up with your sprite(s) again.

Sprites are personas, but not devices; they can’t be part of a PAN or WAN.

### **Decompiling a Sprite**

You can decompile a sprite, trying to stuff it back into the Resonance and out of the Matrix. You can decompile your own sprites if you need to, but usually just dismissing them is enough.

To decompile a sprite, make an Opposed Decompiling + Resonance [Level] v target’s Level (+ compiler’s Resonance if the sprite is registered). Every net hit reduces the sprites owed tasks by 1. If the sprite is reduced to 0 tasks owed to its compiler, it returns to the Resonance on its next action. This causes Fading equal to 2 DV per hit (not net hit) the sprite rolls, with a minimum DV of 2.

### **Sprite Powers**

The following powers are available only to sprites. Using a sprite power is a Standard Resonance Action (not a Matrix action).

**Camouflage**: The sprite can conceal a file within another file in such a way as to make it invisible to Matrix searches. Conceal files can only be found with a Matrix Perception Test that is specifically looking for the hidden file: even the sprite must make this test in order to find and extract the file.

**Cookie**: A sprite uses its cookie power to “tag” a target persona with a cookie file that can be used to track the icon’s Matrix activities. The sprite must successfully beat the target in a Hacking + Resonance [Level] v Intuition + Firewall Test. If the sprite succeeds, the persona starts carrying the cookie file, none the wiser.

The cookie file runs silent and is protected with a Rating equal to the sprite’s Level. The file will log everything the icon does, for example each host the persona enters, the details of any communications the persona engages in (with whom and when, but not the actual contents), any programs the icon uses, etc. Use the net hits to benchmark the depth of the data the cookie accumulates.

At the end of a time determined by the sprite (or its owner) when placed, the cookie file transfers itself and its accumulated data to the sprite. Once the sprite has it, it may turn it over to the technomancer. If the sprite isn’t in the Matrix when the file transfer itself, the file is deleted.

Cookie files may be detected with a successful Matrix Perception Test performed on the carrying persona. Once identified, it may be removed by removing the file’s protection and then deleting it.

**Diagnostics**: The Diagnostics power allows the sprite to evaluate the inner workings of an electronic device. The sprite can assist someone using or repairing the device with a Teamwork Test. The sprite makes a Simple Hardware + Level [System] test; if any hits are rolled, the character gets a +1 limit bonus and each hit adds a +1 dice pool bonus to use or repair the item. This power takes the sprite’s entire attention; the bonus lasts until the sprite drops it or does something else.

**Electron Storm**: This attack allows the sprite to engulf a target persona in a sustained barrage of corrupting datastreams. If the sprite beats the target in a Cybercombat + Resonance [Level] v Intuition + Firewall test, the target is swallowed in a hail of digital pulses. With the first successful attack and on each subsequent action the sprite performs while sustaining this power, it inflicts (Resonance) DV Matrix damage, resisted as normal. The engulfing storm also causes 2 points of noise to the target. If the sprite takes any Matrix damage, all of its electron storms end immediately.

**Gremlins**: This power causes a device to mysteriously malfunction or operate in some (usually detrimental) manner. The spirit targets a device, making a Hardware + Level [Level] v Device Rating + Firewall Test. If the sprite succeeds, the device suffers a glitch. The gamesmaster chooses a malfunction appropriate to the device and situation, like a jammed control, a looped signal or a faulty reading. If the sprite scores 4 or more net hits, treat it as a critical glitch – the device crashes, burns out, jolts its user with an electrical shock or some other goodie picked by the gamesmaster.

**Hash**: The Hash power allows the sprite to temporarily protect a file with a unique Resonance algorithm in such a way that only the sprite can unprotect it. If the sprite stops carrying the hashed file, it reverts to normal. If the sprite is destroyed while carrying the file, the hashed file is permanently corrupted and becomes worthless. The maximum time the sprite can use this power is Level x10 Combat Turns.

**Stability**: A sprite can use this power on any persona or device it has gained an access level to. Stability prevents normal malfunctions or accidents from afflicting the target (including both standard glitches and those induced by the Gremlins or Accident powers). Ignore standard glitches and reduce critical glitches to standard glitches.

**Suppression**: Sprites are confusing at the best of time but a sprite using suppression is just bizarre, especially to hosts. If a sprite is in a host and using this power when the host launches IC, that IC is delayed from launching by (Level/2) Combat Turns. Delayed IC can’t act or be targeted.

**Watermark**: The sprite can tag an icon with an invisible marking that only Resonance-driven entities can see, kind of like a Matrix signature. This allows the sprite to secretly leave messages on Matrix objects. A sprite can overwrite an existing watermark with a new one. A watermark can be erased with the Erase Matrix Signature action; otherwise it lasts as long as the icon does.

### **Sprite Database**

There are different types of sprites that technomancers may compile and rumours abound that there are other kinds in the Resonance. A sprite’s limit on Matrix Actions is their Level.

**Companion Sprite**: Companion sprites are always by your side, right where you need them. They exist to protect and serve.

They will do just about anything to protect their owners if they ask.A compiler may expend all of the companion sprite’s remaining initiative (minimum 10) and tasks (minimum 1) to have the sprite intercept a Matrix attack action targeting the owner. The sprite is destroyed in the process. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |

Any time the sprite’s owner would take 2 or more boxes of fade damage, they may redirect one box to damage to their companion sprite. |     |

**Courier Sprite**: Courier sprites are great at delivering messages securely and are pretty good trackers.

|Courier Sprite (Level Variable)| | | | | | | |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Attack|Stealth|System|Firewall|Cookie|A sprite uses its cookie power to “tag” a target persona with a cookie file that can be used to track the icon’s Matrix activities. The sprite must successfully beat the target in a Hacking + Resonance [Level] v Intuition + Firewall Test. If the sprite succeeds, the persona starts carrying the cookie file, none the wiser.The cookie file runs silent and is protected with a Rating equal to the sprite’s Level. The file will log everything the icon does, for example each host the persona enters, the details of any communications the persona engages in (with whom and when, but not the actual contents), any programs the icon uses, etc. Use the net hits to benchmark the depth of the data the cookie accumulates.At the end of a time determined by the sprite (or its owner) when placed, the cookie file transfers itself and its accumulated data to the sprite. Once the sprite has it, it may turn it over to the technomancer. If the sprite isn’t in the Matrix when the file transfer itself, the file is deleted.Cookie files may be detected with a successful Matrix Perception Test performed on the carrying persona. Once identified, it may be removed by removing the file’s protection and then deleting it.|||

|Skills|ComputerHackingMatrix Perception|LLL|||Hash|The Hash power allows the sprite to temporarily protect a file with a unique Resonance algorithm in such a way that only the sprite can unprotect it. If the sprite stops carrying the hashed file, it reverts to normal. If the sprite is destroyed while carrying the file, the hashed file is permanently corrupted and becomes worthless. The maximum time the sprite can use this power is Level x10 Combat Turns.||

**Crack Sprite**: If you need a sprite for a quiet run that stays under the radar, the Crack sprite has what you need.

|Crack Sprite (Level Variable)| | | | | | | |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Attack|Stealth|System|Firewall|Suppression|Sprites are confusing at the best of time but a sprite using suppression is just bizarre, especially to hosts. If a sprite is in a host and using this power when the host launches IC, that IC is delayed from launching by (Level/2) Combat Turns. Delayed IC can’t act or be targeted.|||

**Data Sprite**: Data sprites are masters of finding and manipulating data. They make great librarians, searchbots and trivia contest riggers.

|Data Sprite (Level Variable)| | | | | | | |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Attack|Stealth|System|Firewall|Camouflage|The sprite can conceal a file within another file in such a way as to make it invisible to Matrix searches. Conceal files can only be found with a Matrix Perception Test that is specifically looking for the hidden file: even the sprite must make this test in order to find and extract the file.|||
|L-1|L|L+4|L+1|||||
|Matrix Initiative|(L x2) +4 +4D6|Resonance|L|||||
|Skills|ComputerElectronic WarfareMatrix Perception|LLL|||Watermark|The sprite can tag an icon with an invisible marking that only Resonance-driven entities can see, kind of like a Matrix signature. This allows the sprite to secretly leave messages on Matrix objects. A sprite can overwrite an existing watermark with a new one. A watermark can be erased with the Erase Matrix Signature action; otherwise it lasts as long as the icon does.||

**Fault Sprite**: The Fault sprite is the one you want to have your back in a fight. Cold as IC and twice as tenacious, they’ll shred your enemies in the blink of an icon.

|Fault Sprite (Level Variable)| | | | | | | |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Attack|Stealth|System|Firewall|Electron Storm|This attack allows the sprite to engulf a target persona in a sustained barrage of corrupting datastreams. If the sprite beats the target in a Cybercombat + Resonance [Level] v Intuition + Firewall test, the target is swallowed in a hail of digital pulses. With the first successful attack and on each subsequent action the sprite performs while sustaining this power, it inflicts (Resonance) DV Matrix damage, resisted as normal. The engulfing storm also causes 2 points of noise to the target. If the sprite takes any Matrix damage, all of its electron storms end immediately.|||

### **Machine Sprite**
Of all the sprites, the Machine sprite is the most likely to interact with the physical world, although that would happen through a device. They’re experts at all sorts of electronics.

The sprite can assist someone using or repairing the device with a Teamwork Test. The sprite makes a Simple Hardware + Level [System] test; if any hits are rolled, the character gets a +1 limit bonus and each hit adds a +1 dice pool bonus to use or repair the item. This power takes the sprite’s entire attention; the bonus lasts until the sprite drops it or does something else.                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The spirit targets a device, making a Hardware + Level [Level] v Device Rating + Firewall Test. If the sprite succeeds, the device suffers a glitch. The gamesmaster chooses a malfunction appropriate to the device and situation, like a jammed control, a looped signal or a faulty reading. If the sprite scores 4 or more net hits, treat it as a critical glitch – the device crashes, burns out, jolts its user with an electrical shock or some other goodie picked by the gamesmaster. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Stability prevents normal malfunctions or accidents from afflicting the target (including both standard glitches and those induced by the Gremlins or Accident powers). Ignore standard glitches and reduce critical glitches to standard glitches. |
