## **LIFESTYLE**

=========================================
Some shadowrunners are in the business to right wrongs or to get revenge. There are a few in the business because they are utter psychopaths. For the rest, though, shadowrunning is mainly a matter of survival. They’re not willing to sell their souls to the corps and they know that begging will get them nowhere. So they scrape up money any way they can so that they can pay for the basics of life – food, shelter and maybe a little fun from time to time.

A character’s lifestyle represents the money they have to spend to live in the way they have selected. This can range from the homeless life of someone scraping up whatever food and temporary shelter they can get their hands on to those who live the lords of the sprawl, dwelling in walled-off palaces or airy condominiums that flaunt the extravagance the owner has earned. Most shadowrunners, of course, are far closer to the former than the later.

At the end of the night, every runner has to have a place to come home to. That place where they hang up their SMG, spells, deck or drone. A character must select one of the lifestyles below to be their primary Lifestyle – this represents the general affluence of their day-to-day life. They may elect to pay other lifestyle costs as well to represent maintaining separate residences for alternate identity or “safehouse” purposes but must pay full cost on all lifestyles they maintain.

### **Luxury**

**Cost**: 100,000¥ per month and up!

This lifestyle offers the best of everything: ritzy digs, lots of high-tech toys, the best food and drink, you name it. The character has a household staff, maid service or sophisticated drones to do the chores. They get by in their massive mansion, snazzy condo or the penthouse suite in a top hotel. Home security is top-of-the-line, with well-trained guards, astral security and quick response times. Their home entertainment system is better than that in public theatres and accessible from anywhere in the home. They’re on the VIP list at several exclusive restaurants and clubs, both real and virtual. This is the life for the high-stakes winners in the world of Shadowrun: high-level executives, government big shots, Yakuza bigwigs and the few shadowrunners who pull of the big scores (and live to spend their pay).

### **High**

**Cost**: 10,000¥ per month

A High lifestyle offers a roomy house or condo, good food and the technology that makes life easy. The character may not have the same perks as the really big boys, but neither do they have as many people gunning for them. Their home is in a secure zone or protected by good, solid bribes to the local police contractor and gang boss. They have a housekeeping service or enough tech to take care of most chores. This is the life for the well-to-do on either side of the law: mid-level managers, senior Mob bosses and the like.

### **Middle**

**Cost**: 5,000¥ per month

The Middle lifestyle offers a nice house or condo with lots of comforts. Character with this lifestyle sometimes eat nutrisoy as well as higher-priced natural food, but at least the autocook has a full suite of flavour faucets. This is the lifestyle of ordinary wage-earners or reasonably successful criminals.

### **Low**

**Cost**: 2,000¥ per month

With this lifestyle, the character has an apartment and nobody is likely to bother them much as long as they keep the door bolted. They can count on regular meals; the nutrisoy may not taste great, but at least it’s hot. Power and water and available during assigned rationing periods. Security depends on how regular the payments to the local street gangs are. Factory workers, petty crooks and other folks stuck in a rut, just starting out or down on their luck tend to have Low lifestyles.

### **Squatter**

**Cost**: 500¥ per month

Life stinks for the squatter and most of the time so does the character. They eat low-grade nutrisoy and yeast, adding flavours with an eyedropper. Their home is a squatted building, perhaps fixed up a bit, possibly even converted into barracks or divided into closet-sized rooms and shared with other squatters. Or maybe they just rent a coffin-sized sleep tank by the night. The only thing worse than the Squatter lifestyle is living on the streets.

### **Streets**

**Cost**: Hey pal, life ain’t all bad. It’s free.

The character lives on the streets – or in the sewers, steam tunnels, condemned buildings or whatever temporary flop they can get. Food is wherever the character finds it, bathing is a thing of the past and the character’s only security is what they create for themselves. This lifestyle is the bottom of the ladder, inhabited by down-and-outers of all stripes.

### **Sample Locations**

#### **High: Bonaparte’s Beachfront Condos Cost: 10,000¥ per month**

Beachfront, overlooking the ocean with quality every step of the way. You have all the furniture and accessories you want, including the matching curtains. Your furniture is higher end and well-made.

*Neighbourhood [5]*

Revere (Rating A: 2D6 +3 minutes Response Time)

This suburb features high-class residences and corporate buildings. Police drones patrol the streets, scanning everyone for their ID and SINs, as well as contraband, and metahuman officers are quick to respond to issues. Neighbourhood watches will report anyone who doesn’t fit in with the right “look” to the police.

*Zen Den* (Asset)

Everyone has to have a place to show off their cool stuff, a place where they are surrounded by things that are fun and comfortable. The zen den is a room dedicated to the hobbies of the character. If could be a physical collection of vintage bottles, a trideo set linked to megapulses worth of trid movies, an immersive sports-viewing room and what-have-you.

#### **Middle: Troy Boston Apartments Cost: 5,000¥ per month**

This 19 story high rise was once touted as a luxury apartment building but time and lack of maintenance have taken their toll. While still a very nice place to live, the building shows signs of its age and the year of wear and tear on the faux-hardwood floors, stone countertops and stainless steel appliances show in the scrapes, dents and dings. While the building contains almost four hundred apartments, they are all either studio, one bedroom or two bedroom at the largest.

*Comforts & Necessities [3+]*

Your apartment is comfortable and cozy with a full bedroom set and matching living room set. There is an AR window that allows you to change your view to one of a decent range of subscriptions. You have stable utilities, although the occasional peak-usage brownout still occurs. It comes with included parking in any space in the adjacent carpark stack, which is usually not filled to capacity. The apartment has a SOTA set of kitchen devices. Soy, krill and mycoprotein are architecturally “printed” into something that looks and tastes like close to the real thing. You can afford bottled water, you have centrally controlled appliances that work, such as a laundry machine and dishwasher, and you have mid-priced new clothing or items you bought on sale from Mortimer of London or Vashon Island. You can afford subscriptions to multiple entertainment sites. Nights on the town are more frequent and you can go to the occasional large event as well as an annual vacation.

*Security [3]*

Your apartment building’s security keeps out unwanted visitors and casual thieves. Determined thieves will have to work to get access to your place. Locks and in-home security are above average (Rating 3). Your neighbours are likely to notice any suspicious characters or loud noises and call security. Smoke detectors and fire suppression systems are standard in all apartments and homes at this level. Your Matrix system has an average firewall and will at least monitor itself for intrusions. There is a Panicbutton in the home connected to contracted police so you can feel safe and secure in your home.

*Neighbourhood [3]*

South Boston (Rating C: 1d6 x5 minutes Response Time)

South Boston is a pleasant, well-kept community. The public utilities, such as electricity and water, are reliable, the wireless coverage is up 24/7 and the neighbourhood has a standing contract with Lone Star. Police drones patrol the streets and you can go out at night without body armour. There are several popular chain restaurants to choose from, the grocery delivery serves are well-stocked and there might even be a park or green space. Neighbourhood watches are common and street crime is not. On the downside, this district requires all metahumans to enable public view of their SIN at all times.

#### **Middle: Atlas Arms   Cost: 10,000¥ per month (this includes the Troll racial increase to Lifestyle costs)**

The Atlas Arms is an oddity: a classy establishment is a nice area, designed and constructed specifically to accommodate trolls. But not, just any trolls. It is marketed specifically to corporate bodyguards – the kind who wear suits and mirrorshades. While expensive, the comfort of having wide hallways, doors you don’t need to stoop under and furniture that doesn’t creak and feel like it’s about to break when you sit on it is considered by many to be worth it. In keeping with its target clientele, it also boasts a high quality gym with troll-sized (and reinforced) equipment as well as a boxing ring and sparring centre.

*Comforts & Necessities [3]*

Your rooms at the Atlas Arms have comfortable furniture, specifically designed for trolls. The walls are fully covered with wallpaper and include AR windows and wallspace programs and subscriptions. A BusyBuddy cleaning drone keeps things clean and your CHN (Central Home Node) is secure. It comes with a designated parking space in an underground garage. Soy is prepared on a multi-function soy processor and is almost indistinguishable from the real thing and you can occasionally splurge on real food like coffee on Sundays. You can afford bottled water, you have centrally controlled appliances that work, such as a laundry machine and dishwasher, and you have mid-priced new clothing or items you bought on sale from Mortimer of London or Vashon Island.

*Security [4]*

The Atlas Arms security is excellent, which deters all but the most determined and well-equipped thieves, including a round-the-clock manned security system. Your doors (front and balcony) have superior maglocks (Rating 4) and reinforced frames. The building’s security team will likely come as backup if there are any problems. You enjoy considerable safety and privacy in the Atlas Arms.

*Neighbourhood [3]*

Mattapan (Rating C: 1d6 x5 minutes Response Time)

Mattapan is a pleasant, well-kept community. The public utilities, such as electricity and water, are reliable, the wireless coverage is up 24/7 and the neighbourhood has a standing contract with Lone Star. Police drones patrol the streets and you can go out at night without body armour. There are several popular chain restaurants to choose from, the grocery delivery serves are well-stocked and there might even be a park or green space. Neighbourhood watches are common and street crime is not. On the downside, this district requires all metahumans to enable public view of their SIN at all times.

*Entertainment - Gym* (Asset)

Weights, treadmill, elliptical quadrilateral, gradient tricycle or whatever device is trending. All training devices and the space around them are troll-sized.

#### **Low: Grey Gables  Cost: 2,000¥ per month**

A squat, grey building that has seen better days but is holding on amid the urban decay. Conveniently, it is located at a hub of city rail, bus lines and the subway allowing for easy transport throughout the city.

*At the beginning of sessions that start after resting in this location, you must roll to resist 2S damage from the fatigue of this lifestyle.*

*Comforts & Necessities [2]*

You can count on regular meals; the nutrisoy may not taste great, but at least it’s hot. Power and water and available during assigned rationing periods. You own some cheap furniture purchased at a mass-market retailer. Still, your chairs match and you have somewhere to sit while enjoying your AR. You have a limited subscription to a virtual wall space program to decorate the apartment. There’s an open parking lot out the back where you can almost always find a space to park. Wireless coverage is available but at a low signal rating. You wear clothes from a second hand store or the sales rack at Kong Wal-Mart and you do your laundry at a cred-op facility.

*Security [2]*

With a maglock that deters crimes of opportunity and a bolt you can slide across your door, you can sleep (relatively) safely at night. The local street gang is in charge of building security and about as effective as their last payoff.

*Neighbourhood [2]*

Brookline (Rating D: 1d6 x12 minutes Response Time)

The neighbourhood has some community to it. Most people live in apartments or multi-family housing and even pay rent. This is a typical part of the sprawl, with dilapidated buildings, petty crime and little maintenance or public services. You can walk the streets during the day without being mugged and a sturdy lock should keep your things safe.

#### **Squatter: Pod Palace   Cost: 500¥ per month**

Anything but a palace, this coffin hotel is cheap, basic and better than sleeping on the street.

*At the beginning of sessions that start after resting in this location, you must roll to resist 4S damage from the fatigue of this lifestyle.*

*Comforts & Necessities [1]*

Sure, the only space you can really call your own is a tube slightly longer and wider than you are, but it’s padded, dry and you can lock it against intruders. Plus, vending machines and shared bathroom facilities (with shutoff timers and no hot water) are available nearby. It’s not luxurious, but it has the basic amenities you need to live, and occasionally they’re even clean. Mostly of you clothing is Vendingwear (recycled plastic shredded and woven into fabric either avocado green or dirt brown in colour). But you do have one good set of second-hand clothes. You have enough food to eat at least one solid meal a day, but it’s unprocessed, unflavoured soy and you drink rainwater or second-hand bottled water with it.

*Security [1]*

The cheap lock is better than nothing and at least there are several hundred pods in the building so it would be hard to find you amongst the rest.

*Neighbourhood [2]*

Medford (Rating D: 1d6 x12 minutes Response Time)

Adjacent to the highway, industrial zone and wildlands that overtook the ruins of entire city blocks, the neighbourhood is one that police patrols only come through when it’s inconvenient to go around. The air pollution is high, water quality low and a day where there isn’t a brownout or blackout it rare.
