# GEAR

## **Concealing Gear**

It’s not just about firepower; sometimes you need to choose the right tool for the setting. Failure to do this can mean getting arrested for carrying a deadly weapon before you make it from the meet to where the job is supposed to go down. Surprise is a shadowrunner’s best friend and carrying a properly hidden hold-out can mean the difference between life and death. As a shadowrunner, you commonly tote around things you don’t want casual onlookers to observe. Things that would attract unwanted attention, even if they aren’t technically illegal. Or hidden “equalisers” you want to act as your ace in the hole. Some items are easier to hide than others, obviously: most hold-out pistols can be stowed away in a bathing suit if that’s what you happen to be wearing, but as awesome as it would be, hiding a katana under your long coat isn’t easy.

### **Noticing Hidden Gear**

Have the observing character make a Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test with a dice pool modified by the item’s Concealability to determine whether they notice the item. This test should be penalised normally by distractions, distance and visibility modifiers. If the observing character generates at least one success, they notice the item concealed on someone else’s person.

### **Actively Hiding Gear**

If you’re intentionally trying to hide something on your person that somebody else is looking for and you’ve taken a little time to hide it (like a Complex Action or so), making an Opposing Palming + Agility [Physical] v Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test. The observing character’s dice pool is modified by the item’s Concealability and they can use Palming in place of Perception if wanted.

If you’re being physically patted down, the searcher can use Agility and their Physical limit instead of Intuition and the Mental limit. Additionally, any negative Concealability modifier is cut in half and any positive Concealability modifier is doubled.

|**Modifier**|**Example Items**|
|:-|:-|
|**-6**|RFID tag, slap patch, microdrone, contact lenses|
|**-4**|Hold-out Pistol, Ammo Clip, Credstick, Lockpick Set, Glasses|
|**-2**|Light Pistol, Knife, Sap, Minidrone|
|**0**|Heavy Pistol, Grenade, Goggles|
|**+2**|SMG, Machine Pistol with Folding Stock Extended, Small Drone, Stun Baton|
|**+4**|Sword, Sawn-off Shotgun, Bullpup Assault Rifle|
|**+6**|Katana, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Crossbow|
|**+8**|Sniper Rifle, Bow, Medium Drone|
|**Forget about it**|Machine gun, rocket launcher, missile launcher, staff, claymore, metahuman body|

## **Carrying Gear**

As long as the players are reasonable and don’t perpetually carry around every firearm and toaster in creation (with enough ammo and bread to operate them both continuously), weights and encumbrance aren’t important. There may, however, be circumstances where knowing roughly how much your character can carry may have an impact on the story – like if you break into a vault full of heavy gold bars and need to figure out how many guns you have to drop to haul out the maximum amount.

### **Carrying Capacity**

Characters can carry their Strength x 10 kilograms in weight without any sort of test – this is your **carrying capacity**. Lifting and carrying more calls for a Strength + Body Test. Each hit increases the weight you can carry by another 10 kilograms.

### **Encumbrance**

If a character overburdens themselves with gear, they suffer encumbrance modifiers. For every 15 kilograms (or part thereof) by which you exceed your carrying capacity, you suffer a -1 modifier to your Physical Limit (minimum limit of 1). This means that a character with Strength 3 (Carrying Capacity 30) that is trudging along with 50 kilograms of equipment suffers a -2 penalty to their Physical Limit.

## **Commlinks**

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they’re used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music player, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image camera, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chips players, credstick readers, voice-access dialling, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, access to ID and accounts, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.

## **Software**

Software can be purchased as an online download or less commonly on chip from physical stores.

**Datasofts**: Datasofts encompass a wide variety of information files, databases containing information on everything from hydraulic fracking to 18<sup>th</sup> century romantic poetry. An appropriate datasoft gives you a +1 bonus to your Mental limit on related Knowledge Skill Tests.

**Mapsofts**: Mapsoft programs feature detailed information about a particular area, from streets to business/residential listings to topographical, census, GPS and environmental data. An interactive interface allows you to quickly determine the best routes and directions, locate the nearest spot of your choice or create your own customised maps. If a wireless link and subscription is maintained, the map automatically self-updates with the latest data from GridGuide. Of course, this feature also means that the mapsoft can be used to track your location.

**Tutorsofts**: These virtual private tutors aid you in learning a specific skill. The tutorsoft makes Instruction Tests with a dice pool equal to its Rating x2. Tutorsofts cannot teach skills based on Magic or Resonance.

*Datasoft*   Variable from 10¥ - 100,000¥  Legal

*Mapsoft*      100¥  Legal

*Tutorsoft (Rating 1-6)*    Rating x400¥ Legal

### **Skillsofts**

A skillsoft program is a recorded skill – digital knowledge and muscle memory. When used in conjunction with the proper augmentations (a **skilljack** for knowsofts and linguasofts as well as a **skillwire system** for activesofts), skillsofts let you know and do things you’ve never otherwise learned. Even kung fu.

Skillsofts aren’t educational tools; you can’t actually learn from them. They’re highly favoured by corporations interested in a cheaper labour force (when the difference between a skilled and unskilled worker can be as simple as slotting a chip, the difference in salary is smaller).

When a skill test is called for, the character may use the Skillsoft in place of the skill. Downside: tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way.

**Activesofts**: Activesofts replace physical active skills, basically every Active skill that isn’t based on Magic or Resonance. A skillwire system is needed to translate the ‘softs into usable muscle memory. There’s a limit to the number of skills you can use at once, based on your skillwire’s rating.

**Knowsofts**: Knowsofts replicate Knowledge skills, actively overwriting the user’s knowledge with their own data. Knowsofts must be accessed with a skilljack and the number you can use at once is limited by the skilljack.

**Linguasofts**: Linguasofts replicate language skills, allowing a user to speak a foreign language by automatically translating signals from the speech cortex, although chipped speech can be awkward and stilted - then again, so can anyone speaking a language that’s not their native tongue. Linguasofts must be accessed with a skilljack, which limits how many skillsofts you can use at a time.

### **ID and Credit**

**Fake System Identification Number (SIN) (Rating 1-4)**    Forbidden Legality

In 2075, you’re just a number. A SIN is what makes a mere metahuman into a real person. Solid citizens receive their SINs at birth and carry them until they die. Not having a SIN means living outside the system, living with restricted or non-existent civil rights. Shadowrunners by default are SINless – they have a SIN only if they have the SINner quality. SINs are digital, not physical objects. They exist on your commlink or in your PAN.

*Rating 1*       1,000¥

*Rating 2*       3,000¥

*Rating 3*       6,000¥

*Rating 4*       10,000¥

**Sidebar**: While having some sort of SIN is mandatory for a person to interact in any way with the “civilized” (as they would put it) world, the level to which a SIN is checked and verified varies widely based on the situation and who is doing the checking. A device checking a SIN will roll a Device Rating x2 Test. The threshold is equal to the rating of the **Fake Sin**. If the number of hits is under the threshold, the system reports no problem. If the threshold is reached but not exceeded, the system reports that something seems “odd” with the SIN and will recommend that the operator investigate further. Whether the operator actually does anything is up to them. If the threshold is exceeded, the system reports the SIN as false and may immediately notify the authorities. At this point, the fake SIN is considered burned.

**Fake Licence (Rating 1-4)**       Forbidden Legality

For those who can’t or won’t go through the standard legal channels, fake licences are available for all kinds of restricted items and activities. Licences are for *Restricted* items. Each type of item or activity permission typically requires a separate licence. Just as SINs essentially exist on your commlink, fake licences exist on a SIN and are linked to it. When you buy a fake concealed-carry licence, you don’t buy it for Murderman the professional shadowrunner, you buy it for John Doe, one of Murderman’s fake SINs. Each licence must be assigned to a particular (fake) SIN and match its rating.

|**Licence**|**Rating 1**|**Rating 2**|**Rating 3**|**Rating 4**|

|**Driver’s Licence**|100¥|200¥|300¥|400¥|

*Certified Credstick Legal*

Cash for the late 21<sup>st</sup> century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person – the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorisation to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They’re not even wireless – you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed below. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it – so don’t get excited when you see a gold credstick until you’ve slotted it and checked its balance.

|**Credstick**|**Max Value**|**Cost**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Standard**|5000|5¥|
|**Silver**|20,000|20¥|
|**Gold**|100,000|100¥|
|**Platinum**|500,000|500¥|

*Online Banking Account       Legal*

Online banking accounts can be accessed at any time via your commlink. Transactions require passcode or biometric verification to be authorised. The good news in no one can (physically) steal your bank account and hacking credit accounts often requires a run to Zurich Orbital or something equally suicidal. The bad news in that digital transactions leave a “paper trail” that, while it can be hidden or concealed, is entirely too traceable for serious criminal activities. Each account must be registered to a particular (usually fake) SIN, unless the account is handled by an anonymous underworld banking service (with its own risks and complications). The cost of banking services is included in your lifestyle costs if you’ve got a Low Lifestyle or better – otherwise you’ll need to keep all your money on credsticks.

*Public Transportation Monthly Pass    50¥  Legal*

You have a monthly pass to access public transportation in your city. This includes bus, subway, ferry or any combination of them. This means, from most places within the city you have transportation access to your destination, with the caveat that it’s not as fast as you make like it.

### **Clothing**

In 2075, you’d have to be crazy to consider walking outside with just a tee-shirt and jeans, even in some of the nicer parts of the Sprawl. You need protection: from the acid rain, from air pollution, from ultraviolent radiation from the completely fragged ozone layer and, of course, from random street violence.

#### **Standard Clothing**

*Armoured Casualwear   Armour 6   450¥  Legal*

Lightweight ballistic fibre weave makes these garments almost impossible to detect as armour. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armour, but it’s available in a wide variety of styles.

*Armoured Team Jersey   Armour 6   750¥  Legal*

Because you never know whose turf you’re tailgating in. Available for most sports but most popular with urban brawl teams that traditionally have the rowdiest fans (read: most likely to riot). +1 Social limit for tests involving fans. -1 Social limit for tests involving fans of rival teams.

*Synthleather Jacket   Armour 4   200¥  Legal*

This waist-length jacket never goes out of style and even offers a modicum of protection. Just don’t expect it to stop bullets.

*Armoured Jacket   Armour 12   1,000¥  Legal*

The most popular armour solution on the streets comes in all styles imaginable. If offers good protection without catching too much attention. But don’t think of wearing one to a dinner party. While the thick jacket protects the body’s core, remember that being shot in the legs may mean you can’t escape and may end up double-tapped.

*Armoured Raincoat   Armour 9   2,000¥  Legal*

Waterproof and ugly yellow, this raincoat protects against more than getting wet with its concealed armour. Gain a +6 dice pool bonus against acid rain and any contact-vector chemical and toxin attacks. You do gain a +2 Concealability modifier to items completely hidden underneath.

*Athleisure Securware   Armour 6   550¥  Legal*

Keeping a well-toned ass from getting shot, a combination of spiderweave threads and ballistic fibre weave provide flexible and fashionable protection that fits in many casual social situations. Crafted with biofabrics, athleisureware provides information wirelessly on the wearer’s general health: body temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and so on. Don’t forget the in-built music player.

*Athleisure Securware – Shockless Armour 6   2,000¥  Legal*

In addition to the usual benefits of athleisure securware, this upgraded line also provides strong resistance to tasers and shocks. (The wearer gains a +6 dice pool bonus against electrical attacks.)

*Fashionable Fur Coat   Armour 0   2,400¥  Legal*

Thermal fibres and heat-retentive materials protect the wearer against Cold damage. Gain a +6 dice pool bonus against cold attacks. You do gain a +2 Concealability modifier to items completely hidden underneath.

*Feedback Armoured Casualwear Armour 6   950¥  Legal*

This haptic clothing allows for a tactile component to an augmented reality experience. Lightweight ballistic fibre weave makes these garments almost impossible to detect as armour. It doesn’t provide as much protection as real armour, but it’s available in a wide variety of styles.

*Poncho - Acid-Rain Resistant  Armour 0   350¥  Legal*

Water-resistant, non-porous, impermeable and with a coating of neutralising agents protect you against acid rain and any contact-vector chemical and toxin attacks (add 1 to those resistance tests). However, it’s rather unfashionable – suffer a -1 Social Limit modifier while it is worn. You do gain a +2 Concealability modifier to items completely hidden underneath.

*Urban Explorer Jumpsuit  Armour 8   800¥  Legal*

Designed for couriers, athletes and freerunners, these colourful jumpsuits are well ventilated and breathable but surprisingly protective with lightweight densiplast and liquid reactive armour. Urban explorer jumpsuits feature a built-in music player and biomonitor.

#### **Concealable Clothing**

*Armour Vest    Armour 9   500¥  Legal*

This modern flexible-wrap vest is designed to be worn under regular clothing without displaying any bulk. A popular and cost-effective option.

*Form-Fitting Body Armour  Armour 10   2,600¥  Legal*

While armoured clothing is effective enough and armoured vests are fairly well hidden, it takes truly advanced craftsmanship to produce form-fitting body armour.

*Second Skin    Armour 6   12,000¥  Legal*

This is a sexy, sick, twisted version of body armour. Each piece of the Second Skin line is custom tailored for the user, which means that a shift in weight of as little as one or two kilos will make the armour lose its most amazing benefit. That benefit is the fact that it is, for all intents and purposes, invisible. The full body unitard is almost undetectable and includes a completely integrated ruthenium polymer system, which allows the wearer to change any or all aspects of the suit’s appearance.

#### **Might Raise an Eyebrow Wear**

*Armoured Ten-gallon Hat  Armour +1   50¥  Legal*

A high-crowned, wide-brimmed hat best know as the defining piece of attire for the North American cowboy. Back in fashion (according to some) this variant incorporated ballistic weave to keep your noggin’ intact.

*Blackout Catsuit   Armour 11   6,650¥  Legal*

This full-body, skin-tight armour leaves little to the imagination but requires a custom-fit. A shift in weight as little as one or two kilos can cause problems.

### **Melee Weapons**

Melee weapons are for ending the lives of people conveniently within arm’s reach. Some runners swear by them, especially those who prefer to kill silently or are afraid of hackers bricking their guns. The damage value of most melee weapons is based on the wielder’s Strength, modified by the weapon.

#### **Blades**

Use the Blades skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Blades is the wielder’s Physical Limit.

*Ceramic/Plasteel Knife  Reach - (STR +1)P AP-1  75¥  Legal*

Ceramic knives are lightweight and non-metallic that are primarily sold as specialty tools. Divers use them because they are resistant to saltwater corrosion and explosive defusing experts use them because they are non-metallic and will not trigger bombs with magnetic anomaly detectors. Plasteel knives share most characteristics with ceramic knives, including being undetectable to MAD scanners. They are most commonly handmade from scraps taken from machinery or vehicles. A few designs are mass manufactured but generally ceramic is the preferred medium due to superior edge retention under heavy use. Both are equally useful to a shadowrunner who wants to sneak a blade into a secure area.

*Claymore, Highland Forge Reach 2 (STR +5)P AP-4  4,500¥  Licence Restricted*

Quality killing in the classic Scottish fashion. An ideal accessory for the troll who thinks a regular sword makes a better toothpick.

A two-handed tungsten-alloy monster, available single- or double-bladed. A hardened thrusting point on be concealed, spring-loaded, in the handle. While it may seem barbaric or primitive, the physical augmentations of 2075 can make an old-school weapon like a combat axe even deadlier than a firearm in the right hands. So go ahead, go medieval.

*Combat Knife   Reach - (STR +2)P AP-3  300¥  Legal*

A long, KA-BAR-style fighting knife with a blacked-out blade and a chisel point for punching through armour.

*Forearm Snap Blades  Reach - (STR +2)P AP-2  300¥  Licence Restricted*

*Katana    Reach 1 (STR +3)P AP-3  1,000¥  Licence Restricted*

The legendary sword of the samurai. The katana has become synonymous not just with street samurai, but with shadowrunners in general, at least in the trids; they’ve got everyone packing a katana, from the decker to the mage. But being a silly cliché doesn’t make this blade any less dangerous or less helpful in a fight.

*Knife    Reach - (STR +1)P AP-1  10¥  Legal*

Your basic, all-purpose street cutter. It comes in a bewildering array of styles, colours and flavours, but the statistics don’t vary from one to the next. Ordinary knives are used by the poor, the desperate or the cautious as backup weapons.

For those who crave a samurai-style extra long blade, the Nippon Steel Nodachi offers reach and power with style.

*Nunchaku   Reach 1 (STR +2)P AP+0  75¥  Licence Restricted*

When properly used, nunchaku can deliver a flurry of blows from a variety of angles. Nunchaku can also be used to choke opponents.

*Pole Arm   Reach 2 (STR +3)P AP-2  1,000¥  Licence Restricted*

This is, at its very essence, a blade on the end of a very long stick. It usually features an axe-head, glaive, spear point or similar maiming implement. It’s not easy to handle and it’s just about impossible to conceal, but it’s popular both with trolls and with melee combatants looking to safely keep said large trolls at more than arm’s length.

*Rapier, Horizon-Flynn Reach 1 (STR +2)P AP-3   500¥  Licence Restricted*

Not every street samurai studies the art of kenjutsu. Some prefer the more elegant Flore del Liberi and thus choose the rapier over the common katana. Horizon and world-renowned bladesmith Dante Flynn have joined forces to create the ultimate tool for slipping past a flawed defence and finding a home in the heart of an enemy. The Horizon-Flynn blade is a slender composite designed for strength, flexibility and stability for maximum armour penetration.

*Sword    Reach 1 (STR +2)P AP-2  300¥  Licence Restricted*

It’s sharp, it’s heavy and it will fragging cut you wide open. Available in a wide variety of styles (wakizashi, scimitar, machete, and so on and so forth), this one-handed blade is not as formidable as a katana but is substantially easier to hide.

*Stun Staff, Nemesis Arms Reach 2 9S(elec) AP-5  1,000¥  Licence Restricted*

Double-sided zapping power! The stun staff is basically a staff with stun batons on each end. They’re rather large and a bit ugly but they look quite intimidating in the hands of the guards at Shiawase HQ.

*Telescoping Staff  Reach 2 (STR+3)P AP+0  350¥  Legal*

This is a metal and composite staff than can telescope down to a reasonable size, one that can be concealed about as easily as a stun baton. It can be extended and lock in place by whirling it at the correct speed and angle and twisting the grip or via a wireless signal. Reading the telescoping staff is a Use Device Action.

#### **Fist Weapons**

Use the Unarmed Combat skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Fist Weapons is the wielder’s Physical Limit.

*Knucks   Reach - (STR+1)P AP+0   100¥  Licence Restricted*

These may be traditional fist-load weapons like brass knuckles or modern “Hardliner gloves” with a thin layer of densiplast located along the knuckles and the edge of the hand. Either way, they substantially boost the impact of a punch, making it potentially deadly.

The gloves deal electrical damage and are good for ten charges before they need to be plugged in and recharged (at a rate of one charge per ten seconds).

### **Projectile and Throwing Weapons**

These weapons are primarily muscle-powered, although some might use simple mechanical assistance for added distance or speed.

#### **Bows**

Use the Archery skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Bows is listed in the weapon description.

Bow  Rating 2  Accuracy: Physical 4P AP+0  200¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 3  Accuracy: Physical 5P AP+0  300¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 4  Accuracy: Physical 6P AP-1  400¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 5  Accuracy: Physical 7P AP-1  500¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 6  Accuracy: Physical 8P AP-1  600¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 7  Accuracy: Physical 9P AP-1  700¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 8  Accuracy: Physical 10P AP-2  800¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 9  Accuracy: Physical 11P AP-2  900¥ Legal

Bow  Rating 10  Accuracy: Physical 12P AP-2  1,000¥ Legal

Arrow  Rating 1-10      Rating x2¥  Legal

This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075 and both have the advantage of being hacker-proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action.

Bows have Rating that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffer a 3 dice pool penalty per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow.

The weapon’s Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow’s Rating or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-allow bow tends to turn wood or fibreglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.

#### **Crossbows**

Use the Archery skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Crossbows is listed in the weapon description.

|Crossbow Type|ACC|DMG|AP|AVAIL|COST|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Light|7|5P|-1|Legal|300¥|
|Medium|7|7P|-2|License Restricted|500¥|
|Heavy|7|10P|-3|License Restricted|1,000¥|

- Crossbow Bolt 5¥  Legal

Modern crossbows are equipped with automatic reloading devices, so unless you’re using a museum piece, reloading doesn’t require a Ready Weapon action. Crossbows have internal magazines holding up to 4 bolts. Crossbows are available in Light, Medium and Heavy sizes.

#### **Throwing Blades**

Use the Thrown Weapons skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Throwing Blades is listed in the weapon description.

*Throwing Blades Accuracy: Physical  (STR+1)P AP-1 25¥  Licence Restricted*

A wide variety of shapes and sizes of aerodynamically balanced, specially weighted, muscle-powered throwing weapons are available, from throwing spikes to darts to kunai and shuriken. A character can ready (Agi/2) of these blades with one Ready Weapon action.

### **Tasers**

Tasers are legal to carry and a great choice for non-lethally incapacitating someone. Tasers, like other electrical weapons, have a flat Armour Penetration value of -5 and deal electricity damage. Use the Handguns skill to fire a taser. Tasers can take only top-mounted accessories.

|**Range**|**Short**|**Medium**|**Long**|**Extreme**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Tasers**|0-5m|6-10m|11-15m|16-20m|

|Yamaha Pulsar|5|7S(elec)|-5|SA|4(Mag)|Legal|180¥|

**Cavalier Safeguard**  
A reliable self-defence weapon, this taser forgoes some wattage in each dart for a larger ammunition capacity and back this with a top-mounted laser for increased accuracy for a less skilled shooter. It still looks sufficiently enough like a pistol to still intimidate targets who might scoff at a mere taser.

>**Laser Sight**: This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1 and grants a +1 dice pool bonus, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the under barrel or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device action.

**Defiance EX Shocker**  
This heavy-duty taser fires up to 4 darts that trail wires up to 20 metres long. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock. Most modern tasers use wireless darts, so the Defiance EX Shocker is an exception. It also features contacts that allow it to be used as a stun weapon in melee. (Accuracy: Physical 8S(elec)  AP-5 Reach 0)

A successful hit with an active wireless connection informs you of the status of the target’s basic health.

**Tiffani-Defiance Protector**  
A sleek taser designed to accessorise well with women’s fashions, with the added benefit of gecko grip to allow it to be set anywhere that is comfortable on the body and a sleek top-mounted laser sight for quick targeting. This is a perfect choice to go with the immortal little black dress, stored under the dashboard of a car or put next to the bed for a good night’s sleep.

>***Laser Sight***  
>This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1 and grants a +1 dice pool bonus, which is not cumulative with smartlink ?modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the under barrel or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device action.

>**Gecko Grip**  
>Having trouble holding on to your gun? Then maybe you shouldn’t have one. But if that’s not an option, try gecko grip, which makes your piece stick in your hand like, well, a gecko hanging on a wall. This gives >your grip a bunch of tiny fibres that are awfully clingy to just about anything. The fibres can be turned on and off via a wireless command or by pressing two buttons at the same time. The mod gives a +6 dice pool >bonus on any test to see if a character keeps their grip on the gun. It can also be used to stick the gun to your jacket, back or roof of your car.

**Tiffani-Defiance Chameleon**  
In addition to the benefits of the Tiffani-Defiance Protector (above), this unadvertised model includes a coating of ruthenium polymers for optical camouflage. Blending in with the colours behind the taser, this modification applies a -2 Concealability modifier to the taser.

**Yamaha Pulsar**  The darts of this taser contain wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar eliminates the need for cumbersome wires. As a trade-off, it is slightly less powerful than the EX Shocker, although it can fire faster. It lacks the EX Shocker’s melee contacts.

A successful hit with an active wireless connection informs you of the status of the target’s basic health.

### **Hold-Outs**

Hold-out pistols are very concealable and are perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up piece. They don’t have much else going for them, being both weak and inaccurate. Use the Handguns skill when firing a hold-out pistol. Hold-outs can’t take mounted accessories.

|**Range**|**Short**|**Medium**|**Long**|**Extreme**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Hold-Outs**|0-5m|6-15m|16-30m|31-50m|

The Needler can only fire flechette rounds. You can change the colours of the Tiffani Needler with a Use Device Action.

*Raecor Sting   Accuracy: 4 SS 6P(f)  AP+5 5 (c) 500¥ Licence Restricted*

The Sting is commonly referred to as a “lemon-squeezer” design, meaning the barrel protrudes from between the firer’s index and middle fingers and the gun is fired by simply making a fist. The circular magazine rotates and automatically loads the next mini-flechette round. Constructed entirely from polyresins, the Sting cannot be detected by magnetic weapon detection systems.

*Streetline Special  Accuracy: 4 SA 6P  AP+0 6 (c) 120¥ Licence Restricted*

Popular among society’s dregs, the Streetline Special is a small, lightweight weapon made of composite materials. Magnetic Anomaly Detectors (MAD Scanners) suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to detect it.

*Walther Palm Pistol  Accuracy: 4 SS/BF 7P  AP+0 2 (b) 180¥ Licence Restricted*

This is a classic double-barreled derringer in an over-under barrel combination. It packs a punch for its size, but on the downside has one of the most diminutive “magazine” capacities on the market – just one bullet per barrel. Both barrels can be fired at once as a short burst (for a -1 Defence modifier instead of the normal -2 for Burst Fire).

### **Light Pistol**

Light pistols are highly accurate and fairly concealable, occupying a comfortable middle ground between Hold-outs and Heavy Pistols. They’re extremely common the streets. Use the Handguns skill when firing a light pistol. Light pistol can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

|**Range**|**Short**|**Medium**|**Long**|**Extreme**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Light Pistols**|0-5m|6-15m|16-30m|31-50m|

*Beretta 201T   Accuracy: 6 SA/BF 6P  AP+0 21 (c) 210¥ Licence Restricted*

This light sidearm is used by many security professionals. It is capable of burst fire. Since the 201T is classified as a light pistol without further limitations, it is quite popular with security agencies in countries where heavy pistols and machine pistols are hard to come by legally. Semi-automatic burst using the Beretta 201T require a Simple Action. The weapon includes a detachable shoulder stock.

*Cavalier Arms Adder Slivergun Accuracy: 5 SA 8P(f)  AP+5 20 (c) 320¥ Licence Restricted*

Oddly enough, this gun was developed as a lightweight personal protection weapon for a mail-delivery corp. Management’s logic was that flechette ammo would be more effective against aggressive dogs and similar paracritters while being less intimidating to customers. It is reminiscent of a pared-down Ares Viper Slivergun. With the modification of an aftermarket silencer, this gun is exceptionally handy for sneaking into a location and striking while the target’s guard is down.

*Colt Agent Special  Accuracy: 5 SA 8P  AP+0 8 (c) 250¥ Licence Restricted*

The Agent Special has been one of Colt’s bestsellers since its introduction over a century ago and continuing updates and upgrades keep it more than relevant. The weapon’s large calibre makes it popular with shooters who prefer hitting power over range. The short barrel also reduces the round’s penetrative power but the ability to use the same ammunition as a heavy pistol means that some organisations are turning to this steady performer to simplify their logistics.

*Colt America L36  Accuracy: 7 SA 7P  AP+0 11 (c) 320¥ Licence Restricted*

A venerable pistol with a great reputation. This basic firearm is cheap, easily concealed and nearly ubiquitous. A perfect throwaway weapon.

*Fichetti Executive Action Accuracy: 6 SA/BF 7P  AP+0 18 (c) 300¥ Licence Restricted*

“Manage your danger with Executive Action!” is the latest in a long series of taglines for this pistol, which incorporates a burst-fire option as standard. With no other truly compelling features, marketing is what this firearm mostly has going for it but that appears to be all it needs to keep selling well.

*Fichetti Security 600  Accuracy: 6(7) SA 7P  AP+0 30 (c) 350¥ Licence Restricted*

A light sidearm for security forces, this weapon’s highly efficient feeding mechanism allows it a thirty-round magazine. The Fichetti Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and under-barrel mounted laser sight.
> ` `*Laser Sight*
\*\
` `This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1 and grants a +1 dice pool bonus, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device action.
> ` `*Folding Stock*
\*\
` `This is a stock. That folds into the weapon. Got it? It provides 1 point of recoil compensation – but only, of course, when it is out and braced against the user’s shoulder. It must be installed in the stock slot and requires a Simple Action to move in or out.

*SK Katzbalger   Accuracy: 6(8) SA 7P  AP+0 12 (c) 1,750¥ Licence Restricted*
> ` `*Electronic Firing*
\*\
` `With this modification, most of the weapon’s moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet’s propellant. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation and a -1 dice pool modifier to sound-based Perception Tests when trying to locate where the weapon is being fired from. The weapon still includes a loading mechanism that moves the bullet into the chamber and it requires caseless ammunition.
> ` `*Trigger Removal*
\*\
` `Sometimes the time it takes to move a finger is too long. Sometimes the pressure of squeezing a trigger is enough to throw off the precision of a long range shot. This is the modification for those times. A smartgun system is necessary for trigger removal, since the gun requires a command delivered wirelessly or through an optical cable to fire. This modification adds +1 Accuracy but is not cumulative with any other modification that adds to Accuracy other than the requisite smartlink. Wireless triggering requires wireless to be turned on. In case you were wondering.
> ` `*Smartgun System, Internal*
\*\
` `This connects a firearm to the user’s smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and a laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup and material stress.

There are a few ways to pull this off – one is to have biometric scanners in the grip or butt of the weapon or the system can scan for an authorized RFID tag to PAN within 1 meter of the weapon. If the authorized user(s) is present or holding the gun, it’ll be ready to fire. If not, no dice.

For simplicity, each kind of gun can trade ammo with another of its class: for example, all heavy pistols can share ammo.

An ammunition type’s Damage Modifier and AP Modifier are added to the weapon’s usual DV and AP.

*APDS rounds  DV+0  AP-4   (per 10 rounds) 200¥ Forbidden Legality*

These are military-grade armour piercing rounds – their full name is armour piercing discarding sabot. They are designed to travel at high velocities and punch through personal body armour. They are highly restricted and hard to acquire.

*Flechette rounds DV+2  AP+5   (per 10 rounds) 65¥ Licence Restricted*

The payload of a flechette round is made up of tiny, tightly packed metal slivers. The round breaks up and shatters on impact, becoming a tumbling hail of shrapnel. Flechette rounds are devastating against unprotected targets, but not as effective against hardened armour.

*Gel rounds  DV Stun AP+1   (per 10 rounds) 25¥ Licence Restricted*

These less-lethal rounds use a hard, jelly-like substance that is a safer alternative to rubber bullets. They are often employed for riot control. Their usually semi-rigid slugs flatten on impact, dispersing their kinetic energy over a larger-than-normal area. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage. Gel rounds reduce the target’s Physical limit by 2 when checking for **Knockdown**.

*Hollow points  DV+1  AP+2   (per 10 rounds) 70¥ Licence Restricted*

Hollow point rounds have their tips indented, so they are designed to “mushroom” or expand on impact, becoming a hail of deadly fragments not unlike flechettes, although hollow points are a much older technology. Like flechettes, follow points work better on unarmoured targets and tend to flatten against armour.

*Regular ammo  DV+0  AP+0   (per 10 rounds) 20¥ Licence Restricted*

Also called ball or full metal jacket rounds, these solid slugs are useful for numerous applications (mainly killing things).

*Subsonic ammo  DV+0  AP+0   (per 10 rounds) 40¥ Forbidden Legality*

Subsonic ammunition features a lighter charge and a slightly smaller bullet than regular rounds. This slows the bullet’s muzzle velocity below the speed of sound, reducing the sound of the weapon being fired and making it easier to silence. Subsonic ammunition applies a -1 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the firing position. This dice pool modifier increases to -6 if a silencer or sound suppressor is used (replacing the usual -4 bonus from silencers or sound suppressors). Increase all penalties due to range by 1.

*Taser Darts  DV+0  AP+0    (each) 5¥ Legal*

These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons.

*Spare Clip [Not ammo, but you probably want it to hold the ammo]  5¥ Legal*

A spare clip comes unloaded by can hold the maximum rounds for the weapon. Each clip is specific to the weapon you buy it for. And yes, it’s technically a detachable box magazine, but the Cityspeak word for it is so popular these days that even the catalogs call them clips.

### **Firearm Accessories**

*Bipod   [Under Mount]      200¥ Legal*

This two-legged brace extends downward from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Simple Action. Removing it is a Complex Action. *Wireless*: Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Bonus Action.

*Electronic Firing [Barrel Mount]      1,000¥ Licence Restricted*

With this modification, most of the weapon’s moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet’s propellant. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation and a -1 dice pool penalty to sound-based Perception Tests when trying to locate where the weapon is being fired from. Electronic firing is usually combined with trigger removal to further reduce the number of moving parts, but this is not mandatory. The weapon still includes a loading mechanism that moves the bullet into the chamber, and it requires caseless ammunition.

*Extended Clip         35¥ Legal*

Sometimes the job calls for the ability to fire more shots without taking time to reload. That is what an extended clip is for. A Rating 1 Extended Clip adds 50% more rounds to the gun’s capacity and a Rating 2 Extending Clip adds 100% more rounds. The downside is that it makes the gun a bit harder to hide (+1 Concealability per Rating). More of an accessory that a modification, an Extended Clip does not use any modification slots.

*Flashlight  [Top or Under Mount]*

Standard Flashlight        25¥ Legal

Low-Light Flashlight        25¥ Legal

Thermographic Flashlight       25¥ Legal

By 2075, most flashlights are long lasting and super bright. Durability and brightness depend on the size – the bulkier, the better. Flashlights are also available in low-light and infrared versions, reducing visibility modifiers for low-light and thermographic vision, respectively. A flashlight can also be mounted to a weapon’s top or under-barrel mount.

*Folding Stock  [Stock Mount]       Legal*

Standard         30¥

Motorised         100¥

This is a stock. That folds into the weapon. Got it? It provides 1 point of recoil compensation – but only, of course, when it is out and braced against the user’s shoulder. It must be installed in the stock slot and requires a Simple Action to move in or out. There is a motorised version that makes folding an unfolding it a Bonus Action with a DNI. When extended, the Concealability Rating is increased by 2.

*Gas-vent System [Barrel Mount]*

*Gas-vent System*  (Rating 1)      200¥ Licence Restricted

*Improved Gas-vent System* (Rating 2)      400¥  Licence Restricted

*Expert Gas-vent System*  (Rating 3)      600¥ Licence Restricted

Gas-vent recoil compression systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems provide a number of points of Recoil Compensation equal to their rating.

*Guncam  [Top, Under, Barrel, Side, Internal Mount]    Legal*

*Guncam*   (Rating 1)      350¥ Licence Restricted

*Guncam*   (Rating 2)      500¥  Licence Restricted

*Guncam*   (Rating 3)      650¥ Licence Restricted

The device that launched a thousand stupid-ass MeFeed videos. Whatever the gun is pointing at, it records. Yeah, you don’t always want a recording of what you’re about to shoot but sometimes that footage is invaluable – whether you need to show Mr. Johnson what you managed to pull off, review footage to help you plan your next move or doctor what you filmed to make you look good, the video you film has plenty of possible uses. Its Device Rating fills in for any necessary stats. Guncams can be installed in the Top, Under, Barrel, Side or Internal slots.

*Hidden Arm Slide [Accessory]      600¥ Licence Restricted*

Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can accommodate a hold-out, light pistol or taser. With a hand gesture, the slide releases the weapon right into your hand. If you quick draw the weapon in this slide, the threshold for a quick draw is 2. It also gives the weapon a -1 Concealability modifier. *Wireless*: You can ready the weapon in the slide as a Bonus Action.

*Holographic Sight [Top Mount]      200¥ Legal*

Offers the same benefits as a laser sight without the red trail of light giving away the position of the shooter. In addition, the holographic (or holo) sight can display basic information such as range to target or remaining ammo without the wielder using AR. The only downside is the necessary top mount sometimes gets in the way, making quick draw attempts require 1 extra success.

*Holster, Concealable [Accessory]      150¥ Legal*

This small holster can be worn on the ankle, clipped to the forearm, in the small of the back, or anywhere else it’s unlikely to be seen. The concealable holster adds -1 to the item’s Concealability. Only hold-outs, light pistols and tasers fit in a Concealable Holster.

*Holster, Quick-draw [Accessory]      200¥ Legal*

This easy access holster can hold a weapon of light pistol or smaller size. It reduces the threshold for quick-drawing the holstered weapon by 1.

*Holster, Concealable Quick-draw [Accessory]    500¥ Legal*

What more do you want a holster to do? You get to reduce the Concealability modifier of your weapon by 1 while the threshold to quick-draw a holstered weapon drops by 1. It won’t fire the thing for you though, so buckle down and do it yourself. Only hold-outs, light pistols and tasers fit in a Concealable Quick-draw Holster.

*Imaging Scope  [Top Mount]      300¥ Legal*

These classic scopes are attached to the top mount; attaching or removing them takes only a Simple Action. Imaging scopes include a micro camera and vision magnification and they have a Capacity of 3 to hold vision enhancements. *Wireless*: The scope’s vision can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).

*Laser Sight  [Top or Under-barrel Mount]    125¥ Legal*

This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device Action.

*Longbarrel  [Barrel Mount]      300¥ Licence Restricted*

This modification involves replacing the stock barrel with a longer one thereby increasing bullet velocity. Increase Accuracy by 1, while increasing the Concealability modifier by +1.

*Retractable Bayonet [Under-barrel Mount]     200¥ Legal*

This modification adds an underbarrel sheath that conceals a retractable bayonet. The bayonet can be extended as a Use Device Action. When attached to a Longarms weapon and extended, it has Reach 2, DV (STR+1)P and AP -1. If attached to a Pistol, the Reach is 1.

*Sawed Off/Shortbarrel [Barrel Mount]      20¥ Licence Restricted*

This common modification reduced damage by 1 but increases Concealability by 1. It eliminates the gun’s ability to mount barrel modifications. If combined with stock removal, the Accuracy is also reduced by 1 in addition to the other benefits and penalties listed. Can only be used on Heavy Pistols and weapons in the Longarms skill group.

*Silencer/Suppressor [Barrel Mount]      500¥ Forbidden Legality*

This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound and flash of a weapon’s discharge. It cannot be used with revolvers or shotguns. It applies a -4 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Complex Action.

*Shock Pad  [Stock Mount]      50¥ Legal*

A shock-absorbing pad is situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun or heavy weapon and provides 1 point of recoil compensation.

*Speed Loader  [Accessory]      25¥ Legal*

The speed loader is a simple device that holds a ring of bullets for fast insertion into a revolver’s cylinder. Each speed loader is specific to the weapon it was designed for. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Complex Action instead of having to load rounds one at a time, loading only (Agility) rounds as a Complex Action.

*Stock Removal  [Stock Mount]      20¥ Legal*

Removing the stock reduces both the recoil compensation and the Concealability of a gun by 1. Weapon modifications such as a shock pad or any other stock modifications cannot be applied. If combined with sawed off the Accuracy is also reduced by 1 in addition to the other benefits and penalties listed.

*Trigger Removal        50¥ Legal*

Sometimes the time it takes to move a finger is too long. Sometimes the pressure of squeezing a trigger is enough to throw off the precision of a long range shot. This is the modification for those times. A smartgun system is necessary for trigger removal, singe the gun requires a command delivered wirelessly or through an optical cable to fire. This modification adds +1 Accuracy but is not cumulative with any other modification that adds to Accuracy other than the requisite smartlink. Wireless triggering requires wireless to be turned on. In case you were wondering.

#### **Sidebar: Quick Draw**

A character may attempt to quick-draw a pistol, pistol-sized weapon or small throwing weapon and immediately fire it by using a Quick Draw Simple Action. For a character to successfully draw the weapon, the player must make a (Weapon Skill) + Reaction [Physical] (3) Test. If the test is successful, the character draws the weapon and fires as a single Simple Action. If the test fails, the weapon is drawn but cannot be fired with the same action. If there is a glitch, the weapon is stuck in the holster or dropped and no more actions are allowed. In a critical glitch, a drawn blade may be fumbled out of the character’s reach or a pistol accidentally fired while still in the holster; the gamemaster decides the exact nature of the screw-up. Two weapons may be quick-drawn and fired simultaneously, but the dice pool is split and off-hand penalties apply.

### **Grenades**

Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Use the Throwing Weapons skill when throwing grenades or Heavy Weapons when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher.

*Flash-bang DV 10S AP-4       100¥ Licence Restricted*

Upon detonation, these “concussion” or “stun” grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast distributed equally over a radius of 10 metres.

*Gas        Chemical Cost+ 40¥ Licence Restricted*

Instead of exploding, the gas grenade releases a cloud of gas over an area with a radius of 10 metres. This is usually riot control/CS gas, but many other chemical or toxin payloads can be chosen. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation).

*Smoke          40¥ Licence Restricted*

A smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke over an areas with a diameter of 10 metres. The cloud obscures vision, applying visibility modifiers for smoke to relevant tests. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation). Heavy Smoke -6, Moderate Smoke -3, Light Smoke -1.

*Thermal Smoke         60¥ Licence Restricted*

A thermal smoke grenade contains hot particles designed to obscure thermographic vision. Once released, a cloud of smoke obscures an area with a diameter of 10 metres. The cloud obscures vision, applying visibility modifiers for thermal smoke to relevant tests. The cloud lasts for approximately 10 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation). Heavy Smoke -6, Moderate Smoke -3, Light Smoke -1.

### **Misc Equipment**

*Bug Scanner, Handheld         Licence Restricted*

*Rating 1          100¥*

*Rating 2          200¥*

*Rating 3          300¥*

Also called a radio signal scanner, this device locates and locks in wireless devices within 20 metres. The scanner can also measure a signal’s strength and pinpoint its location. To operate a bug scanner, roll Electronic Warfare + Logic [Rating]. A device that is running silent can use its Firewall [Firewall] to defend against the scan. If you get any net hits at all, you find the device. You may substitute the scanner’s Rating for your Electronic Warfare skill when you use it.

*Cyberware Scanner, Handheld        Licence Restricted*

*Rating 1          100¥*

*Rating 2          200¥*

*Rating 3          300¥*

Cyberware scanners, also known as millimetre wave detection systems, process video taken in the millimetre wave spectrum to identify the energy signature of cyberware and concealed items (specifically weapons) on a person. These devices can “see through” thick layers of clothing and other concealment to identify items from a distance of up to fifteen metres away. To determine if the detector scans cyberware or a prohibited item, roll twice the Rating of the scanner (and any dice pool modifier from the table below) and compare the hits scored to the thresholds given on the Cyberware Scanner Table. Millimetre wave scans can detect any non-biological item by its shape and composition, assuming the item is listed in the device’s database. If the threshold is reached, the scanner detects the item/implant and notes its general locations and type; additional hits provide more detail (function, model, grade, etc.).

|**Cyberware Scanner Table**||
| :- | :- |
|**|Item**|**Threshold**|
|Standard cyberware, weapons|1|
|Alphaware, other items|2|
|Betaware|3|

A built-in trode net is an optional extra for the smart wig, allowing a direct neural interface (DNI).

*Synthskin Face Mask       100¥/Rating Forbidden Legality*

The synthskin facemask is composed of a programmable electropolymer commonly used in the skin covering of synthetic cyberware and humanoid mimic drones. It produces a lifelike replica of an individual’s face. A person’s face can be duplicated if you have a scan from a biometric reader (with a dice pool bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the biometric reader’s Rating). A Software + Logic Test (with a dice pool bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the successes) can replicate a specific individual’s face or create a completely unique appearance. In either case, the limit on the test is equal to the Rating of the mask. The mask is reusable in the sense that it can be worn multiple times, but once an appearance has been set in either fashion described above, it cannot be altered.

*Trodes         2 Cap 70¥ Legal*

Available as a headband, net or full-on cap, the electrode-and-ultrasound net gives you a direct neural interface. Useful if you’re too squeamish to get a hold drilled in your head for a datajack.

### **Vision Enhancement**

Non-cyberware enhancements for equipment. A number of options are available for installation in visual sensors and imaging devices from contacts to cameras. Each enhancement has an associated Capacity cost.

*Flare Compensation       1 Cap  250¥ Legal*

This protects you from blinding flashes of light as well as simple glare. It mitigates the vision modifiers for glares and reduces the penalty from flashing lights.

*Image Link        1 Cap  25¥ Legal*

A standard upgrade, this lets you display visual information (text, pictures, movies, the current time, etc.) in your field of vision. This is usually AROs, but you can display pretty much whatever you want to on it. You and your team can use it to share tactical and situational info in real time. An image link is what you need to truly “see” AR and participate in the modern world.

*Low-Light Vision       1 Cap  500¥ Legal*

This allows you to see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness, though.

*Polychromic Lens (Contacts only)     1 Cap  100¥ Legal*

This feature can be added to contacts and allows an individual to change the apparent colour and pattern of their retina. The contacts can be changed via wireless connection to any appearance imaginable, though the resolution is not as precise as Retinal Duplication cyberware and cannot fool a biometric reader.

*Smartlink        1 Cap  2,000¥ Restricted Licence*

This accessory interacts with a smartgun system to project the weapon’s angle of fire into the user’s vision, centring red crosshairs where the user is pointing and highlighting perceived targets. The smartgun’s laser rangefinder also calculates and displays the distance to the target. Additional data from the weapon, such as the ammunition level, heat buildup and stress can also be displayed. Requires an Image Link.

*Thermographic Vision       1 Cap  500¥ Legal*

This enables vision in the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately and so on.

*Vision Enhancement          Legal*

*Rating 1         1 Cap  500¥*

*Rating 2         1 Cap  1,000¥*

*Rating 3         1 Cap  1,500¥*

This sharpens a character’s vision at all ranges, providing visual acuity closer to that of the average hawk than that of the average metahuman. It adds its Rating as a dice pool modifier to your visual Perception Tests and their Limit.

*Vision Magnification       1 Cap  250¥ Legal*

This zoom function digitally magnifies vision up to fifty times, allowing distant targets to be seen clearly. After using a Take Aim action, you reduce the Range modifier by one category.

### **Electronic Accessories**

*AR Gloves (Device Rating 3)       150¥ Legal*

AR gloves allow you to manually interact with the Matrix in Augmented Reality mode, letting you “touch” and “hold” virtual AROs and receiving tactile force-feedback.

*Meta AR Gloves (Device Rating 1)    50¥ Legal*

Plain grey gloves in a “one-size-fits-all” size that allow AR manipulation.

*AR Nails  (Device Rating 1)      200¥ Legal*

Synthetic fingernails that function the same as AR gloves.

*Biometric Reader (Device Rating 3)      200¥ Legal*

Sometimes someone online likes to know it’s really you. This handheld device can be used for fingerprints, retina scans, voice patterns, tongue prints – pretty much anything but a DNA scan. You can use it to lock your electronics so only you (or one of your body parts) can unlock it.

*Datachip          5¥ Legal*

For occasions when you want to transfer data by physical means – like bringing the project specs on the competition’s new cyberdeck to Mr Johnson in person at the meet – a datachip can hold enormous quantities of data in a small finger-sized chip, accessible to any electronic device. Datachips have no wireless capability, so you need to plug them into a universal data connector (found on any device) if you want to read or write to them.

*Electronic Paper (Device Rating 1)      5¥ Legal*

This electronic sheet is anywhere from post-it note to poster sized and it can be folded or rolled up. It digitally displays images, text, data or video and can act as a touchscreen. Electronic paper is wireless and can be written on or erased wirelessly. Sometimes hacker gangs cover the surfaces of buildings in electronic paper so they are constantly changing and overwritten with graffiti that can be seen even by people with their AR image-links turned off.

*Hitcher Jack          250¥ Legal*

This cyberdeck attachment allows non-cybered companions to accompany a decker into the Matrix. They can view the Matrix as the decker views it but cannot interact with it.

*RFID            Legal*

These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

` `*Security Tags       10¥ Legal*

Security-conscious megacorps often implant these security tags in their sararimen and valued citizens, either to monitor employee workplace productivity, grant and deny clearance and security access or track employees in the case of abduction or extraction (or escape). These same tags are used on incarcerated and paroled criminals and parents and schools also use them to track students. Security tags cannot be simply erased with a tag eraser due to EMP hardening. If a tag is implanted under the skin, an Extended Medicine + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 minute) Test is needed to remove it.

` `*Sensor Tags       40¥ Legal*

A sensor RFID can be equipped with a single sensor (sold separately) of up to Rating 2. It then records everything it can, to a maximum of 24 hours of time, at which point it can be programmed to either shut off or overwrite data older than 24 hours. Sensor tags are often used for diagnostic purposes in various devices.

*Stealth Tags       20¥ License Restricted*

A stealth tag always runs in hidden mode and usually has a Stealth Rating equal to its Device Rating. Stealth tags are often used as backup for security tags by megacorps that are security conscious (and sneaky). They can be implanted the same way security tags can.

*Simrig   (Device Rating 3)      1,000¥ Legal*

This simsense recorder can record experience data (sensory and emotive) from you or whoever is wearing it. Simrigs are used to make the most of the simsense chips sold on the market. You’ll need to have a working sim module (with the DNI interface) to make a recording.

*Subvocal Microphone (Device Rating 1)      50¥ Legal*

The next best thing to telepathy is the ability to stage-whisper at any range. Attached with adhesive to your throat, this hard-to-spot microphone lets you communicate via subvocalized speech. A -4 dice pool modifier is applied to Perception Tests to overhear you when you’re subvocalizing.

*Tag Eraser          450¥ Licence Restricted*

This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other small, unshielded electronics. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimetres of an electronic device and activate it, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The tag eraser has one charge but can be full recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.

*Trid Projector  (Device Rating 3)      200¥ Legal*

This device projects a trideo hologram into a five-meter cube right next to or above the device. The hologram can be quite realistic, but unless you’re really artistic about it, it’s pretty obvious that it’s just trid.

*White Noise Generator          Legal*

*Rating 1           50¥*

*Rating 2           100¥*

*Rating 3           150¥*

*Rating 4           200¥*

*Rating 5           250¥*

*Rating 6           300¥*

This device creates a field of random noise, masking the sounds within its area and preventing direct audio surveillance. All Perception Tests to overhear a conversation within (Rating) meters of a white noise generator receive a dice pool penalty equal to twice the device’s Rating. If more than one generator is in use, only count the highest rating. A white noise generator is redundant in a noisy environment (such as a nightclub or a firefight) and does not help to curtail video surveillance or jam wireless signals.

Add the medkit’s rating to your dice pool on First Aid tests. The medkit needs to be restocked after every (Rating uses).

*Biomonitor          300¥ Legal*

This compact device measures life signs – heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and so on. The biomonitor can also analyse blood, sweat and skin samples. Used by medical services and patients who need to monitor their own health, biomonitors can be worn as an armband or wristband or integrated into clothing or commlinks. Attaching a biomonitor is a Simple Action.

#### **Slap Patches**

Slap patches are adhesive dermal chemical dispensers that allow continual, safe administration of chemicals. They are applied directly to the patient’s skin. Applying a slap patch to an unwilling patient’s requires a successful melee attack (which deals no damage), which may be tricky if the target doesn’t have much exposed skin. Applying a slap patch is a Simple Action.

*Stim Patch           Legal*

*Rating 1           25¥*

*Rating 2           50¥*

*Rating 3           750¥*

*Rating 5           125¥*

*Rating 6           150¥*

This patch removes a number of boxes of Stun damage equal to its Rating. This effect lasts for (Rating x 10) minutes – after that period of time the patient takes (Rating +1) unresisted Stun damage (which may become physical overflow by that point). While the stimulant patch is in effect, the character is unable to rest. Frequent use of stimulant patches may require Addiction Tests. Treat it as Addiction Rating 2, Addiction Threshold 1.

*Trauma Patch          500¥ Legal*

If placed on a dying patient, this allows them to make an immediate stabilisation test using Body + Willpower (3). If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage. Additional stabilisation tests can be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

*Tranq Patch (Rating 1-10) Rating x 20¥*

This patch inflicts Stun damage equal to its rating, resisted with Body.

*Vasotech Autoinjection Gun         Legal*

The Vasotech Multidose Autoinjector System is a favourite among military and civilian combat medics. These compact handheld devices resemble a pistol. When pressed against a subject’s skin, the autoinjector rapidly sterilised a small field and administers an injection from a multidose drug reservoir. The MD-9 model features a single larger reservoir that stores up to nine doses, whereas the newer MD-3X model features three smaller reservoirs, each of which holds up to three doses. In game terms, an autoinjector allows a medic to administer an injectable drug with a Simple Action. Changing reservoirs with the MD-3X requires a Use Device Action.

*MD-9 Autoinjection Gun        1,000¥*

*MD-3X Autoinjection Gun        1,500¥*

### **Drugs**

*Aztech Chew         10¥ Legal*

Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation

Speed: 1 minute

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 2 (2)]

Effect: +1 Reaction, Pain Resistance 1

This legal drug first gained popularity in the early days of the Native American Nations and is traditionally made from an ancient formula including tobacco leaves, cannabis resin and willow bark. Modern aztech chew typically forgoes the expensive natural ingredients by directly combining the active chemical compounds involved: THC, nicotine and salicin. Aztech chew users claim the drug has a calming effect. Once the effect wears off, users experience -1 Intuition for a time period equivalent to twice the original duration. Some claim that long-term users are more susceptible to fatigue and cancer.

*Betel          5¥ Legal*

Vector: Ingestion

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological [Special]

Effect: +1 Perception

An ancient and widespread Asian practice of chewing nuts and leaves of the betel tree with lime has led to the synthesis of Wuxing’s highly addictive and legal betel chewing gum. Betel is a mild stimulant with cavity-fighting properties; users commonly feel awake and alert when using it. Rather than making an Addiction Test, characters who use betel, even once, gain a Mild addiction to it. A character may never have an addiction worse than Mild to betel. Characters who add dice to toxin resistance tests are immune to this effect if they succeed at a Toxin Resistance Test. Because it is instantly addictive, betel often serves as a gateway drug to more powerful stimulants.

*Bliss          30¥ Forbidden Legality*

Vector: Inhalation, Injection

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Duration: (6-Body) hours, minimum 1 hour

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 5 (3)]

Speed: Immediate

Duration: (12-Body) hours, minimum 1 hour

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 5 (3)]

Effect: Immunity to Fear (see below)

This drug suppresses the functions of the brain that govern fear, both innate and learned. For the duration of the drug’s effects, the character is immune to fear (including negative results from Composure Tests) and fear-based powers/attacks. As a drawback, however, the character becomes reckless, incautious and also less inhibited. At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may call for the character to make a Logic + Willpower (3) Test to avoid doing something that would normally be considered foolish, dangerous or socially inappropriate.

*Cram          20¥ Restricted Licence*

Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation

Speed: 10 minutes

Duration: (12-Body) hours, minimum 1 hour

Addiction Type: Psychological [Rating 4 (3)]

Effect: +1 Reaction, +1D6 Initiative Dice

Cram is an extremely popular stimulant. When this drug wears off, users crash and suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). Cram users appear hyper-alert, almost to the point of paranoia. They react quickly, often without thought and they’re prone to irrational outbursts. Other common side effects are jitteriness and fidgeting.

*Crash          800¥ Legal*

Vector: Injection

Speed: Immediate

Power: Special

Addiction Type: None

Effect: Special

Crash is an injectable form of the potent vasoactive and stimulant drugs found in a trauma patch. When given intravenously, crash allows the subject to make a Stabilisation Test using Body + Willpower (3). If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage. Additional stabilisation tests can be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

*Jazz          75¥ Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 8 (3)]

Effect: +1 Reaction, +1 Physical Limit, +2D6 Initiative Dice

Jazz is a stimulant designed to better the odds for run-of-the-mill law-enforcement officers who run up against augmented street samurai. It’s usually taken from a single-dose inhaler (or “popper”) When jazz wears off, the user crashes and is flooded with despondent and miserable emotions, suffering the effects of Disorientation for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effects. While cram makes people hyper and twitchy, jazz makes people as jumpy and hyper as caffeinated two-year-olds.

*Kamikaze         100¥ Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological [Rating 9 (3)]

Effect: +1 Body, +1 Agility, +2 Strength, +1 Willpower, +2 Physical Limit, +2D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance 3

Kamikaze is a tailored combat stimulant. When kamikaze wears off, the user crashes and suffers -1 Reaction, -1 Willpower and -2 to all Limits for a duration equal to that of the initial effect. They also suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). The repeated use of kamikaze has a destructive effect on the user’s metabolism. Large doses can cause excitement, tremors, momentary euphoria and dilated pupils. Excess doses (bordering on overdose level) cause anxiety, hallucinations and uncontrolled muscular movements. Even higher dosages lead to death. Kamikaze users are near-crazed, filled with a feeling of imperviousness and invincibility, exhibiting almost no regard for their own well-being. They can be entertaining to watch, as long as you’re not in front of them.

*Long Haul         50¥ Legal*

Vector: Injection

Speed: 10 minutes

Duration: 4 days

Addiction Type: Psychological [Rating 2 (1)]

Effect: Alleviates need for sleep

A combination of synthesised hormones and other brain-regulating chemicals, long haul stimulates the brain and keeps the user awake, obviating the need for sleep. A character dosed on long haul can remain awake for four days – without incurring any modifiers from fatigue or weariness. After this time, however, the user immediately passes out and sleeps soundly for 8D6 hours. If the character is kept awake during this period, he suffers from disorientation as he is afflicted with hallucinations and an inability to concentrate. If a second dose of long haul is taken after the first has worn off, the character can stay awake an additional 1D6 /2 days. After that period, they suffer 10 Stun damage (unresisted) and must crash as detailed above. Long haul cannot keep a character awake past this point, no matter how many additional doses are administered.

*Nitro          50¥ Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 9 (3)]

Effect: +2 Strength, +2 Willpower, +2 Perception, +2 Physical Limit, High Pain Tolerance 6

A dangerous combination of potent drugs favoured by troll gangers, nitro is a powerful stimulant that can easily kill a user. After the drug’s effects wear off, the subject suffers -2 to all limits and takes 9 Stun damage (unresisted) for an equal duration. Nitro users feel infused with energy, suffer a diminished attention span and talk incessantly (even to themselves).

*Ondansetron         50¥ Legal*

Vector: Ingestion, Injection

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: None

Effect: Counteracts the effects of Nausea

Ondansetron is a powerful anti-emetic drug that works rapidly on the central nervous system to relieve nausea. When administered to a character suffering from the effects of Nausea, double the subject’s Willpower for the purposes of determining incapacitation. Ondansetron also halves the duration of Nausea.

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: 5 minutes

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Psychological [Rating 3 (1)]

Effect: -2 Reaction, +1 Willpower, -1 physical action dice pool penalty

A psychedelic hallucinogen, zen is popular among those looking to escape reality or seeking trance-like states.

### **Toxins**

Knockout drugs. Truth serum. Nerve gas. All of these are examples of toxins, a catch-all term for a substance that’s mostly meant for use as a weapon, as opposed to recreation. Each substance has several attribute ratings.

*CS/Tear Gas         20¥ Restricted Legality*

Vector: Contact, Inhalation

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Penetration: 0

Power: 8

Effect: Disorientation, Nausea, Stun Damage

CS gas is an irritant that affects the eyes, skin and mucus membranes, causing them to burn to water. It also stimulates a physiological panic response: increased heart rate, shortness of breath and so forth. Washing thoroughly with soap and water can remove CS from the victim’s skin, thus ending the duration of the nausea prematurely. CS gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.

*Narcoject         50¥ Restricted Legality*

Vector: Injection

Speed: Immediate

Penetration: 0

Power: 15

Effect: Stun Damage

A common tranquiliser, narcoject is typically used with dart guns. It has no side effects.

Power: 11

Effect: Nausea, Stun Damage

Pepper punch is an irritant combining CS and oleo-capsicum, the active ingredient in hot peppers, along with other chemicals. It is typically deployed as a liquid spray for personal defence and deterrence; this agent is often tagged with RFID tags or special dyes to identify victims later. Someone dosed with pepper punch feels an intense burning on any affected skin; this effect is even more pronounced if it gets in the eyes, nose or mouth. Victims sprayed in the eyes have trouble seeing and breathing becomes difficult.

### **Cyberdecks**

If you were a decker and someone swung a monofilament claymore at you, you’d protect your cyberdeck with your body and not the other way around. This isn’t just because the things are fraggin’ expensive – cyberdecks (or decks) are a decker’s life’s blood, an all-in-one ticket to hacking the planet. The most common form of a deck is a smooth, flat, elongated rectangle, slim with plenty of display space for touch controls, although they can take many forms.

All cyberdecks include illegal hot-sim modules right out of the box.

It can act like a commlink and has all the features of a commlink in addition to the cool hacking stuff.

This cyber-chariot allows deckers to ride out in confidence and style. At least, that’s what the advertising promises. In reality, it is an effective deck for the budget conscious managing small sites. Powerful enough to dump any script-kiddies who are playing in your turf, but lacking the power to battle master deckers, who probably wouldn’t be after data in the kind of system you’re guarding anyway.

*Novatech Navigator      119,200¥  Licence Restricted*

*Response 5 Signal 4 Firewall 5 System 4  Processor Limit 8 Matrix Condition 10*

*Programs: Analyse 4, Browse 5, Command 3, Edit 4*

This cyberdeck was built with its purpose in mind. If offers speed, power and protection, while cutting down on areas more important to riggers that deckers, such as signal and command programs. The decker with a Novatech Navigator and true skill can navigate through hosts and slice ice with the big boys.

*Renraku Tsurugi      139,650¥  Licence Restricted*

*Programs: Analyse 5, Browse 5, Command 4, Edit 5*

While released as the better, faster, stronger competitor with the Novatech Navigator, this cyberdeck didn’t gain the market lead its creators hoped for. While critics acknowledge that it is overall a more powerful deck that many of its rivals, it also has a price that’s higher as well. The question raised by critics is whether all the features will be utilised by the typical user and, if not, whether it’s worth paying the premium for them?

*Shiawase Cyber-4      159,650¥  Licence Restricted*

*Response 6 Signal 5 Firewall 5 System 5  Processor Limit 9 Matrix Condition 11*

*Programs: Analyse 4, Browse 5, Command 5, Edit 5*

The first product of Shiawase’s reboot of the Fuchi Cyber line, the Cyber-5, was a deck that had high praise but low sales figures, criticised for being out of reach of the larger cybersecurity market. The Cyber-4 was introduced as a low-price, high-performance cyberdeck, undercutting the price point of the CIY-720 while outperforming the more popular cyberdeck in some areas. This model will save you a lot of money but has its own flaws. Tread carefully.

*XIAO MPG-1       172,650¥  Licence Restricted*

*Response 6 Signal 6 Firewall 5 System 5  Processor Limit 10 Matrix Condition 12*

*Programs: Analyse 5, Browse 5, Command 4, Edit 5*

The MPG-1 is designed by our friends at the Midwest Pirate’s Guild with one deadly purpose: smash everything in your way before it can hit back. Lots of IC was harmed in the making of this deck.

*Sony CIY-720       173,100¥  Licence Restricted*

*Response 5 Signal 6 Firewall 5 System 6  Processor Limit 10 Matrix Condition 12*

*Programs: Analyse 5, Browse 6, Command 4, Edit 6*

This cyberdeck filled a high-end niche at the time with strong performance and a price point midway between its competitors. However, with the almost simultaneous release of the Shiawase Cyber-4 just undercutting the price, sales dropped significantly below predictions. While the timing was suspicious, that’s the way of the free market.

*Global Sandstorm Sirocco     186,250¥  Licence Restricted*

*Response 6 Signal 5 Firewall 6 System 6  Processor Limit 10 Matrix Condition 13*

*Programs: Analyse 6, Browse 5, Command 5, Edit 5*

*Hardening: 1*

The Sirocco was based on designs by Sandstorm Engineering before the merger with Global Oil to form Global Sandstorm. It became the peak of security spider anti-decker tech in the middle east.

### **Control Rig**

This implant harnesses the raw data-co-ordinating and synchronisation power of the middle brain for the express purpose of directly manipulating rigged vehicles and drones (and other devices with rigger interface, like turrets). It has a built-in sim module, so you can use it for DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable (it’s like getting a free datajack). When you’re jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its Rating as a dice pool bonus on all Vehicle skill tests. Additionally, the rating of your control rig is added to the Handling and Acceleration of any vehicle you are jumped into. As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), even when you’re jumped in.

*Control Rig          Licence Restricted*

*Rating 1       0.5 Essence 10,000¥*

*Rating 2       1 Essence  25,000¥*

### **Rigger Command Console (RCC)**

A deck for controlling drones, vehicles and security systems. It’s about the size of a briefcase. The main purpose of the RCC is to create a PAN with your drones. If a drone is slaved to a rigger command console and isn’t running any of its own programs, it uses the programs running on the RCC. This can exceed its normal program limit.

It can act like a commlink and has all the features of a commlink in addition to the cool drone stuff.

Rating 5       4,500¥

Rating 6       6,000¥

A mix of Edit and Browse subroutines, Corrupt programs are designed to track down and demolish specific information in a node without actually deleting the files in which they are saved. The idea is that, since deleted files can be restored from back-ups, Corrupt edits the files to overwrite the targeted information while leaving the file intact, without making any indication of the alteration, so that the corrupted file is eventually backed up as well, making detection and recovery of the original more difficult.

Rating 6       6,000¥

Stealth is a clever hacker program that attempts to hide the hacker from other system processes. While it cannot make an icon completely undetectable, it makes the hacker seem innocuous by obfuscating their activities, erasing system tracks and mimicking authorised traffic. While it is not used for any action, Stealth hides the hacker from detection by the Firewall as they break into a system, as well as from Matrix Perception tests and Trace User attempts.

Rating 6       6,000¥

Track programs systematically analyse a user’s connection and follow the datatrail back to the originating node. Track is commonly used as an intrusion countermeasure with the intent of identifying and locating a hacker or launching a counterattack, but it is also used to keep tabs on automated taxis and emergency service calls.

### **Custom Programs**

*Black Hammer        Forbidden Legality*

Rating 6       12,000¥

Black Hammer is a program that samples the command transactions between the target and their device and injects dangerous biofeedback responses into the target’s simsense interface. These aggravated signals may overload the target’s neural connections and in turn render them unconscious or cause death from stroke, heart failure, respiratory paralysis, aneurysm or neurotransmitter autotoxicity – and those are just a few of the possible effects. It is used with a Matrix Attack action.

*Blackout        Forbidden Legality*

Rating 6       9,000¥

Blackout is a non-lethal version of Black Hammer. It causes Stun damage to both hot sim and cold sim VR users. Like Black Hammer, it is used with the Matrix Attack action. It has no effect on programs, IC, sprites or AR users. Damage from Blackout does not overflow into the Physical Condition Monitor.

*Cat’s Paw        Forbidden Legality*

Rating 4       3,000¥

A low-offensive attack program that distracts the user instead of damaging the device they are using. Cat’s Paw is useful to prevent a user from performing Matrix actions while not bricking the device they may be using. This program fills the AR display or VR experience with annoying errors, spam pop-ups and pop-unders or other distracting garbage. On a successful Matrix Attack action, instead of doing damage, the program generates a negative dice pool penalty equal to 2 + the number of net hits on the Matrix Attack action.

### **Foci**

There are several categories of foci: Enchanting, Power, Qi, Sorcery, Spirit and Weapon.

*Enchanting Foci*

*Force 1*          5,000¥ Licence Restricted

Qi foci only work for adepts. They channel mana into your adept powers. A qi focus can be an object, like other foci, but can also be worked into a body modification, like tattoos, ritual scarring and piercings. Each focus is specific to a single adept power at a specific level. While the focus is active, you get the power contained in it, or if you already have the power, the focus’s levels are added to your own (if it’s a power with levels).

**<a name="_toc218024816"></a>AUGMENTATION**\

============================================
Cyberware and bioware augmentations are everywhere in 2075. For the rich, the poor and everyone in between, bodyshops on every street corner offer minor modifications at your convenience, legally and otherwise. Even the gang-bangers on those street corners might be equipped with cybernetic vision, hearing enhancements or datajacks.

### **Cybersurgery and Recovery Time**

Getting cyberware and bioware installed hurts. When you have an augmentation implanted (after character creation), your Physical and Stun Condition Monitors each take damage from the procedure (more damage the more extensive and invasive the procedure). Most cyberclinics and body shops offer recovery rooms for patients to rest and heal up after cybersurgery but beware the sterility and cleanliness of the less-reputable chop shops.

*Synthetic*       15,000¥  [2] Capacity

In fact, more of a shell than a full replacement, after all, the squishy parts inside aren’t being replaced. Cyberskulls can have other cyberwear installed within them. In addition, it provides an additional physical damage box on the Condition Monitor.

*Cyberskull, Partial        0.4 Essence Legal*

*Obvious*        8,000¥  [4] Capacity

*Synthetic*       12,000¥  [2] Capacity

The partial cyberskull is another throwback classic that’s seeing a comeback. By upgrading one side of the skull with a large interface board, quite a few upgrades can be installed directly into it, rather than requiring difficult surgery repeatedly, but it is less invasive and far less dangerous than a full cyberskull.

*Datajack       1,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

A datajack gives you a direct neural interface (DNI), which can be handy in a lot of situations. It comes with a retractable spool of micro-cable (about a meter long) that lets you directly interface with any electronic device via a universal access cable. Datajacks are equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or saving files. Two datajack users can string a fibreoptic cable between themselves to conduct a private mental communication immune to radio interception or eavesdropping. Most Use Device Actions can be triggered with a DNI Use Device Action instead (going from a Simple Action to a Bonus Action).

*[Alphaware] High Quality Datajack*   1,200¥  0.08 Essence Legal

*Data Lock         0.1 Essence Legal*

*Rating 1   (Firewall 1)*    1,000¥

*Rating 5   (Firewall 5)*    5,000¥

*Rating 6   (Firewall 6)*    6,000¥

This special datajack is popular with couriers, spies, diplomatic aides and executive liaisons. Effectively, it turns the character in whom it is installed into a walking data safe. The data lock protects the data from anyone not authorised to access it (possibly including you). Data locks are not wireless enabled; they can only be accessed via universal data connector. In fact, the bearer of the implant doesn’t have mental access to the data – they’re only a carrier.

*False Face       20,000¥  0.5 Essence Restricted Licence*

Intended for use by actors, shadowrunners quickly found other uses for the false face, resulting in it being restricted in most countries and corporations. The bones of the face are replaced with dozens of small ceramic plates that may be adjusted and rotated by micro-servos implanted beneath them. Combined with small reservoirs of gel that allow inflation or deflation of facial features, this allows the user to resculpt their face to a wide variety of versions possible with their metatype. False face provides a +4 dice pool bonus to a character’s Disguise Tests. Changing one’s face takes 1 minute of concentration and is somewhat painful.

*[Alphaware] Fine False Face*   25,000¥  0.4 Essence Restricted Licence

*Smaller ceramic plates, more widely dispersed gel reservoirs and higher quality micro-servos but no reduction in the pain caused.*

*Fangs (Retractable) STR(P)     500¥  0.15 Essence Legal*

Fangs come in both retractable and non-retractable versions. Fangs are difficult to use as weapons – lower the user’s Physical Limit by 2 when trying to attack an aware target with fangs.

*[Alphaware] Tepes Retractable Fangs*   600¥  0.12 Essence Legal

*For the true devotees.*

*Fibre-Optic Hair      100¥/10cm 0.1 Essence Legal*

The original scalp hair (or facial hair) is removed and replaced with artificial hair composed of fibreoptic cabling. This hair is not only available in every imaginable colour, but is programmable, allowing for patterns, designs or scrolling effects that nature could never manage. From sparkling stars in a nightscape of black to an explosion of neon colours to a scrolling advert of your favourite hair salon, the only real limit is one’s imagination. Cost is based on length (to a maximum of 1m). The user may activate a downloaded colour pattern as a Use Device Action.

*[Alphaware] Fibre-Optic Hair*   120¥/10cm 0.08 Essence Legal

*Now with in-built frizz control!*

*Horn Compartment      1,000¥  - Essence  Legal*

Similar to a tooth compartment but larger, the horn compartment gives a slick way to carry credsticks, RFID tags or other small items. As the with tooth compartment, it can be equipped to remove the enclosed items with either a wireless signal or a hidden catch.

*Horn Implants   STR(P)    400¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

*Horn Implants (Retractable) STR(P)    1,000¥  0.15 Essence Legal*

Synthetic horns come in a wide array of shapes and sizes, from curled troll horns to devil horns to single rhinoceros-style horns. Horns are usually installed in the skull, but some users implant rows of horns to form a “bone crest” along the head, neck and/or back. All horn implants are structurally braced for use in combat. Retractable “telescoping” models are also available to give users the advantage of surprise. Each two minor horns (similar to those of a goat) count as one implant, as do single larger horns (such as those of a rhinoceros or ram).

*Olfactory Booster        0.2 Essence Legal*

*Rating 1*        4,000¥

*Rating 2*        8,000¥

*Rating 3*        12,000¥

*Rating 4*        16,000¥

This cybersnout enhances, identifies and records smells and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a while new world of sensory data to you – you’ll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scent-hound would. You can smell people’s emotions in their sweat, traces of ammunition propellant, explosives or biological and chemical warfare compounds – the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odours, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. Add the booster’s Rating as a dice pool modifier to your scent-based Perception Tests.

*[Alphaware] Hubert Olfactory Booster*  20,000¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Finer quality discernment of the high-end input with an even faster response time. For those who know that sometimes life is on the line.*

*Oral Slasher       750¥  0.25 Ess/3 Cap Forbidden Legality*

A spool of pointed wire placed under the tongue, the oral slasher is more truthfully called the oral thruster, launched forward by compressed air to impale the target before being quickly rewound, not unlike a frog’s tongue, only more dangerous. With a range of only one metre, the slasher is a melee weapon covered by the Exotic Weapon Skill.

*Skilljack           Legal*

*Rating 5*        20,000¥  0.5 Essence

*Rating 6*        24,000¥  0.6 Essence

This headware interprets knowsofts and linguasofts for your brain so you can use them as though they were your own. It can also run activesofts but they only act similarly to Knowledge Skills unless you have skillwires. The total of all skills running on a skilljack cannot exceed its Rating x2 and the maximum Rating for a skill is the skilljack’s Rating. Starting skills from storage and stopping skills is a Bonus Action. You can’t use Edge with skills you have through a skilljack. If you have more than one skilljack, only one of them can operate at a time.

*Subvocal Microphone      250¥  0.05 Essence  Legal*

The next best thing to telepathy is the ability to stage-whisper at any range. This implanted microphone lets you communicate via subvocalized speech. A -4 dice pool modifier is applied to Perception Tests to overhear you when you’re subvocalizing.

*Tooth Compartment      800¥  - Essence  Legal*

The oldest cyberware on the market, these hollow teeth come in storage and breakable models. The storage model is used to smuggle really, really tiny contraband, the size of a datachip or a really small RFID tag. Items can be removed with a wireless signal or hidden catch. The breakable model triggers a linked effect (such as starting a tracking signal or releasing deadly poison into your mouth – make sure you remember which is which!) with a wireless signal or it may trigger when you bite down hard on the tooth.

*Voice Amplifier       1,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

Go loud or go home. An in-built cybernetic amplifier for your voice. You can speak with an increased volume (up to 100 decibels) without strain.

*Voice Mask       2,000¥  0.1 Essence Forbidden Legality*

A much-downgraded version of the voice modulator, the voice mask doesn’t allow for modification of the volume or frequency of the user’s voice, nor does it allow recording, rebroadcasting or replication of someone else’s voice. What it does, however, is use dissonant frequencies to totally distort the user’s voice and make it completely unrecognisable and useless for identification.

*Voice Modulator        0.2 Essence Forbidden Legality*

*Rating 1*        5,000¥

*Rating 2*        10,000¥

*Rating 3*        15,000¥

*Rating 4*        20,000¥

This implant gives you perfect pitch and enormous vocal flexibility and distortion capabilities. You can speak with an increased volume (up to 100 decibels) without strain, shift your pitch to make perfect bird calls or mellifluous singing and, most importantly, uncanny vocal impressions. The modulator can also play back (and more or less perfectly imitate) a recorded or captured voice. Add the Rating of the modulator as a dice pool bonus for Impersonation Skill Tests.

*Cybereyes           Legal*

*Rating 1*    Capacity [4]*   2,500¥  0.2 Essence

*Rating 2*    Capacity [8]*   4,500¥  0.3 Essence

*Rating 3*    Capacity [12]*   8,500¥  0.4 Essence

*Rating 4*    Capacity [16]*   14,500¥  0.5 Essence

The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link at no extra cost, as well as capacity for vision enhancements.

` `*Image Link*          Legal

A standard upgrade, this lets you display visual information (text, pictures, movies the current time, etc.) in your field of vision. This is usually AROs but you can display pretty much whatever you want on it. You and your team can use it to share tactical and situational info in real time. An image link is what you need to truly “see” AR and participate in the modern world.

*Eye Laser System      2,000¥  3 Cap  Legal*

This miniaturised laser system is only available for cybereyes and may be upgraded with additional functionality with some minor hardware adjustments and software upgrades. The basic eye laser system features a “look-to-talk” system, allowing the user to communicate and transmit information via infrared laser to another character with an eye laser system or external laser talk gear. The laser transmits through one eye and receives through the other. This communication system has the advantage of being discreet and, unlike wireless radio, is immune to jamming and interception. The lasers must be immobile and pointed towards each other and fog, smoke or other conditions may affect the transmission. The eye laser may also be used to scan barcodes and other optical glyphs.

*Eye Laser Microphone      1,500¥  2 Cap  Restricted Licence*

The eye laser microphone can be used for surveillance purposes. This bounces a laser beam against a solid object like a windowpane, reads the vibrational variations of the surface and translates them into the sounds that are occurring on the other side of the surface. Use a Perception + Intuition [Device Rating] Test. Maximum range is 100 metres.

*Eye Laser Rangefinder      1,000¥  1 Cap  Legal*

The eye laser rangefinder emits a laser beam that is reflected off a target’s surface and picked up by a detector to calculate the exact distance.

*Eye-Light System – White Light     500¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal*

The eye light system involves a pair of miniscule, high-power but low-heat lights installed into the user’s cybereyes. The mechanism is attached to the forward inner wall of the eye, with a second, smaller pupil installed to allow it to shine out. The light has a range of two meters and allow for a person with low-light vision to see for a range of ten times that. The thin beam illuminates an area roughly the size of a sheet of paper or half a fuse box, allowing for a wide range of activities while leaving the hands completely free. Activating or deactivating the eye light system is a Use Device Action.

` `*Red – Nightvision Saving Light*    600¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal

Rather than standard white light, this version illuminates the area in a red, nightvision saving light that is harder to detect from a distance.

` `*Ultraviolet Light*      750¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal

Ultraviolet light, invisible to regular sight lights the area. The ability to see in ultraviolet light is sold separately.

*Eye Recording Unit      1,500¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

This connects to the user’s optical nerves (or cybereye) and records all data directly into storage (accessible by the user’s PAN).

*Flare Compensation      1,000¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

This protects you from blinding flashes of light as well as simple glare. It mitigates the vision modifiers for glares and reduces the penalty from flashing lights.

*Low-Light Vision      1,000¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal*

This allows you to see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness, though.

*Microscopic Vision      1,500¥  0.2 Ess/3 Cap Legal*

Take your lab with you, but don’t forget your slides! Microscopic lenses allow for refocusing of the eye to a massive magnification of tiny, tiny objects, up to 1000x their normal size. When microscopic lenses are active, the user’s eye is unsuitable for any other task but a Use Device Action allows the lens to be switched on or off. An item further away than 30 centimetres is beyond the focal ability of active microscopic lenses. When microscopic lenses are being used, in addition to the obvious use, they provide a +4 dice pool bonus on Perception tests to examine the material in question.

*Smartlink       3,000¥  0.2 Ess/3 Cap Restricted Licence*

This accessory interacts with a smartgun system to project the weapon’s angle of fire into the user’s vision, centring red crosshairs where the user is pointing and highlighting perceived targets. The smartgun’s laser rangefinder also calculates and displays the distance to the target. Additional data from the weapon, such as the ammunition level, heat buildup and stress can also be displayed. Requires an Image Link.

` `*Subdermal Induction Pad*     500¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Restricted Licence

Implanted in the palm, this allows the user to link with a smartgun system through their grip, rather than a hackable wireless connection.

*Thermographic Vision      1,500¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal*

This enables vision in the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately and so on.

*Vision Enhancement          Legal*

*Rating 1**        4,000¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap

*Rating 2**        8,000¥  0.2 Ess/2 Cap

*Rating 3**        12,000¥  0.3 Ess/3 Cap

This sharpens a character’s vision at all ranges, providing visual acuity closer to that of the average hawk than that of the average metahuman. It adds its Rating as a dice pool modifier to your visual Perception Tests and their Limit.

*Vision Magnification      2,000¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal*

This zoom function digitally magnifies vision up to fifty times, allowing distant targets to be seen clearly. p177

*Rating 4*    Capacity [16]*   11,000¥  0.5 Essence

Ordinarily, cyberears replace only the inner ear, although the whole thing can be replaced as well if you like. Cyberears offer hearing with normal ranges, a sound link and Capacity for modifications and enhancements.

` `*Sound Link*

The sound link can play audio (recordings, movie soundtracks, music, etc.) from linked sources within the user’s PAN (or headware memory or datajack) directly into the user’s cyberears. A sound link is a common component of immersive AR environments, adding a sonic component.

*Antennae       500¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

With an extended antenna array, the user can send and receive wireless signals easier than without. Available in both retractable and fragile or non-retractable and sturdy options for the same cost, they are often, but not always, taken in pairs and come in a wide variety of designs, shapes and colours. The antenna array reduces Noise by 1 for the user.

*Audio Analyser       1,000¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

A simple bit of hardware that measures and identifies both pitch and timbre, audio analyser is quite useful for musicians and impersonators, but it can also allow eavesdropping of old touch-tone datapads. The audio analyser raises the Social limit by 1 for musical performances by the user.

*Audio Enhancement          Legal*

*Rating 1**        4,000¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap

*Rating 2**        8,000¥  0.2 Ess/2 Cap

*Rating 3**        12,000¥  0.3 Ess/3 Cap

Audio enhancement allows the user to hear a broader spectrum of audio frequencies, including high and low frequencies outside the normal metahuman audible spectrum. The user also experiences fine discrimination of nuances and can block out distracting background noise. Audio enhancement adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus and Limit.

*Balance Augmenter      5,000¥  0.1 Ess/4 Cap Legal*

The balance augmenter enhances the inner ear’s natural balance mechanism. You receive a +1 dice pool bonus on all tests involving balance, such as climbing, walking across a narrow platform, landing after a jump and so on.

*Damper       2,000¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

This implant protects the user from sudden increases in sound as well as damaging sound levels. The damper adds a +2 dice pool bonus to resisting sonic attacks, including flashbangs.

*Increased Hearing Spectrum     2,000¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

A basic augmentation that expands the user’s hearing spectrum beyond the typical metahuman breadth of 20 Hz to 20 kHz as well as beyond typical audio enhancements. The user’s hearing extends as low as 5 Hz, into infrasonic sound and as high as 120 kHz into the ultrasonic. This allows the user to hear sounds outside the normal range, such as dog whistles or ultrasound-based motion detectors, which would otherwise go unnoticed. If combined with a device to create such sounds, such as a voice modulator, then a method of signalling or even communication can be employed that is difficult for those without the augmentation to listen in on.

*Sound Filter           Legal*

*Rating 1**        3,500¥  0.1 Essence/1 Cap

This lets you block out background noise and focus on specific sounds or patterns of sounds. It even includes speech, word and sound pattern recognition. Each Rating point lets you select a single sound group (such as the footsteps of a patrolling guard or the rotors of a distant helicopter) and focus on it. You only actively listen to one group at a time, but you can record the others for later playback or set them to triggered monitoring (such as sounding an alert if a conversation brings up a certain topic or if there’s a variation in the breathing pattern of a guard dog).

*Spatial Recogniser      4,000¥  0.1 Ess/2 Cap Legal*

This hearing accessory pinpoints the source of a sound. You get a +2 dice pool bonus to your audio-based Perception Tests and their limit.

#### **Bodyware**

*Auto-Injector      500¥  0.05 Essence Legal*

Originally, auto-injectors were devices that released medication into a person’s body either when needed or on a regular time schedule. It took the street about thirty seconds to realise that you could replace, say, insulin with combat drugs and suddenly you have a sneaky boosting technology. While the base auto-injector is designed to hold a single dose of a chemical, an auxiliary storage unit is often implanted to allow up to five additional doses. The auto-injector is normally refilled from an external port. Not that while different chemicals can’t be mixed in a single dispensary, multiple injectors may be implanted to create a veritable salad bar of chemical cocktails.

*Expanded Reservoir (+5 doses)*   250¥  0.05 Essence Legal

*Balance Tail      2,000¥  0.25 Essence Legal*

Largely having fallen out of favour for their bioware cousins, balance tails are cybernetic tails extended from the user’s spine, focused on improved stability and balance. The tail is controlled by a dedicated sub-processor at the base of the spine and is autonomous, often moving about on its own without the user’s awareness as it quietly compensates for natural motion. While the base tail is in the always-classic chrome, faux-fur cat tails are, by far, the dominant style. Tails must be at least knee-length to be functional, but most are slightly longer than the user’s legs.

The balance tail raises the user’s Physical limit by 1 for all tests requiring balance, such as climbing, jumping or running. It also raises the user’s Physical limit by one for purposes of resisting knockdown.

*Biomonitor      500¥  0.1 Ess/1 Cap Legal*

While this is simply an implanted version of the standard biomonitor, its cybernetic natures allows it to integrate the user’s augmentations into calculations so that, for instance, a user’s bone structure will not read as damaged just because they have plastic implants. It provides constant updates in their personal PAN, making checking your vitals into a Bonus Action.

*Biowaste Storage Expansion        Legal*

Hard plastic and ceramic fibre plates are bonded to the user’s skin. The plates are clearly visible and are even more obvious to the touch but they can be cosmetically stylised for colour and surface texture. Dermal plating gives you bonus Armour equal to its Rating (cumulative with other Armour, without adding Encumbrance). Dermal plating cannot be combined with other augmentations to the skin that provide armour, including orthoskin.

Quite popular with sailors, acrobats and those orbital-intended workers. The user is immune to Nausea.

*Grapple Gun       5,000¥  0.5 Essence Restricted Licence*

This is an implanted version of the grapple gun. It can shoot a grappling hook up to 120 metres (the limit of its extreme range). (Ranges: Short 0-6m / Medium 7-24m / Long 25-60m / 61-120m.) It comes equipped with an internal winch to pull back the grapple (or pull up loads) Use the *Exotic Ranged Weapon – Grappling Hook* skill to shoot it. It doesn’t store any rope inside it, but you can attach an external rope before you shoot the grapple. Micro rope can support a weight of up to 100kg; standard and stealth ropes can support a weight of up to 400 kg. Reinforced rope can support a weight of up to 600kg.

*Internal Air Tank*

*Rating 1*        4,500¥  0.25 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        6,500¥  0.25 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        8,000¥  0.25 Essence Legal

The internal air tank replaces part of one lung with a pressurised internal air reserve that allows you to hold your breath for up to (Rating) hours. This allows extended underwater operations and complete protection from inhalation-vector toxin attacks as long as you’re holding your breath. Activating or de-activating the tank is a Use Device Action. It can also be set to activate automatically if it detects the need for air. If linked to your PAN, you can always be aware of the tank’s exact air level and purity. Refilling the air tank with pressurised air through an intake valve (located under your ribcage) takes about five minutes per hour of air tank capacity needed, or you can refill it through six hours of normal breathing per hour of air tank capacity.

*Internal Router       15,000¥  0.7 Essence Legal*

Using the body’s internal neural network as “wires”, the internal router allows the user’s cybernetics to communicate with one another as if they were wirelessly connected and, if expanded via a datajack or similar broadcast-enabled piece of cyberware, with the rest of the user’s gear.

*LED Tattoos           Legal*

*Small*        100¥+  0.05 Ess/1 Cap

*Medium*        500¥+  0.1 Ess/2 Cap

*Large*        1,000¥+  0.2 Ess/4Cap

LED tattoos have staged a surprising comeback. A simple LED display is implanted under the skin, bright enough to be seen through the dermal layer when active, vanishing from sight when inactive. Available in three general sizes – small (placed on a wrist, ankle or behind an ear), medium (covering much of a forearm or upper arm, the small of the back or over the heart) or large (covering most of the back or scalp) – LED tattoos combine the showcasing of one’s interests and expression of personality with the ability to remove or change those that are no longer quite so definitive. The ability to deactivate them further allows for someone to switch between club mode, where they fly their freak flag, and work mode, where they blend in with sedate corporate culture. It should be noted that there is some division between those with “real” tattoos and “light posers” who are unwilling to get proper ink done.

*Muscle Replacement*

*Rating 1 Cheap Charlie Muscles*     25,000¥  1 Essence  Restricted Licence

*Rating 2 Built Brick Muscles*      50,000¥  2 Essence  Restricted Licence

*Rating 3 Arnie Awesome Muscles*     75,000¥  3 Essence  Restricted Licence

Why take the time to exercise when you can just install a physique? Vat-grown synthetic muscles replace or augment your own and calcium treatments and skeletal reinforcement contribute to your overall strength. It increases both your Strength and Agility attributes by its rating. It cannot be combined with other augmentations to the muscles (such as muscle augmentation or muscle toner bioware).

*Nutrition Storage System*

*Rating 1*        500¥  0.1 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        1,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        1,500¥  0.3 Essence Legal

An onboard reserve of tasteless food paste and water, the former released directly into your stomach, the later into your mouth and throat. Each Rating point allows for a day’s worth of food and water to be stored. The reservoirs are refilled through an external port and part of the user’s Lifestyle cost. This augmentation is not compatible with the elastic stomach genetech.

*Reaction Enhancers*

*Rating 1*        13,000¥  0.3 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*        26,000¥  0.6 Essence Restricted Licence

By replacing specific, isolated vertebrae of your spinal column with segments of superconducting material, your reactions to events become quicker. Add the Rating of reactions enhancers to your Reaction attribute (and remember to adjust Initiative and Physical limit accordingly). Reaction enhancers are incompatible with other enhancements to Reaction, except Wired Reflexes.

*[Alphaware] Elite Reaction Enhancers (Rating 2)*  32,000¥  0.48 Essence Restricted Licence

*For the Elite!*

*Skillwires*

*Rating 1*        2,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        4,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        6,000¥  0.3 Essence Legal

Skillwires are a system of neuromuscular controllers that overlie the body’s natural nervous system; they are capable of aiding or completely overriding muscular movement, controlled by the “muscle memory” played through a skilljack. This system allows you to use activesofts with a rating up to your skillwire’s rating, but only if that activesoft is running on your implanted skilljack. Skillwires are incompatible with reflex recorder bioware.

*Skin Toner       8,000¥  0.5 Essence Legal*

Gently weaving ruthenium polymer into the user’s skin and implanting a dedicated control system to watch over it, skin toner allows the user to select any shade of colour for their skin tone. The limited processor requires the entire body to be generally the same colour, minus some minor gradients for tanning, flesh density and so forth. The user may change skin colour with a Use Device Action.

*[Alphaware] Transformative Epidermis*    10,000¥  0.4 Essence Legal

*This upgraded tech allows even finer control and allows freckle patterns!*

*Smuggling Compartments     7,500¥  0.2 Essence Legal*

For items that won’t fit in a fingertip but that you still can’t afford to have found, smuggling compartments can be placed in part of the body that can be easily hollowed out/replaced. This includes ribs and the space between them, hip bones, shoulder blades and so forth. These compartments can allow the storage of small and mini-sized items of appropriate size and shape. The compartment has a Concealability of -10. Inserting or retrieving on object requires a Complex Action.

*Wired Reflexes*

*Rating 1*        30,000¥  2 Essence  Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*        140,000¥  3 Essence  Restricted Licence

This highly invasive, painful, life-changing operation adds a multitude of neural boosters and adrenaline stimulators in strategic locations throughout your body work to catapult you into a whole new world where everything around you seem to move in slow motion. Those with wired reflexes tend to be twitchy and even their regular movements may appear unusual. Each rating point of wired reflexes gives you +1 Reaction (and accompanying bonus to Initiative and Physical limit) and +1D6 Initiative Die. Wired reflexes cannot be combined with any other form of Initiative enhancement, except Reaction Enhancers.

*Reflex Trigger*      9,000¥  0.2 Essence

A reflex trigger is an accessory for wired reflexes, allowing the user to cybernetically turn the reflexes on or off as a Use Device Action. The wired reflexes and the reflex trigger must be installed simultaneously, as a package; the trigger cannot be retrofitted later. When turned off, the reflex trigger adds 1 to the threshold for tests to detect the wired reflexes with a cyberware scanner.

*Stepped Reflex Trigger*     11,000¥  0.2 Essence

Rather than completely turning off their wired reflexes, some users prefer to turn them down. This modification to the reflex trigger allows users to operate their wired reflexes at a lower level than the level at which they were purchased.

*[Alphaware] Renraku Redline Reflexes*    48,000¥  1.76 Essence Restricted Licence

*Redline your reflexes because you know you can push it to the max. With stepped reflex trigger included!*

#### **Cyberlimbs**

In today’s world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and -torsos are considered cyberlimbs, although they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

Cyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility Ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test, use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and -feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply to tests directly involving those limbs). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity.

Cyberlimbs give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity Cost [in brackets]. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don’t have cyberweapons installed – their unarmed DV is (STR)P.

*Obvious Cyberlimbs:* These implants are immediately recognisable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colours but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellent and disturbing. This can affect your social dealing in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.

*Synthetic Cyberlimbs:* Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The face that they’re cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone’s looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.

*Full Arm         1 Essence  Legal*

*Synthetic*        25,000¥  5 Capacity

#### **Cyberlimb Upgrades**

*Bulk Modification          Legal*

Most cyberlimbs are designed to be relatively lifelike – extremely so in the case of synthetic limbs, but there are those who wear their chrome loud and proud and, for them, the bulk modification is a gift from above. While only available for obvious cyberlimbs, the bulk modification trades for greater volume and with greater volume comes more upgrade capabilities. While bulk modification is available in six Rating, the limb in question is limited to Rating 1 for a hand/foot/half-skull, Rating 2 for lower arm/lower leg/skull, Rating 3 for full arm/full leg and Rating 6 for the torso.

For each point of Rating, the modified limb gains +1 Capacity.

*Rating 1*        500¥  +[1] Capacity

*Rating 2*        1,000¥  +[2] Capacity

*Rating 3*        1,500¥  +[3] Capacity

*Rating 4*        2,000¥  +[4] Capacity

*Rating 5*        2,500¥  +[5] Capacity

*Rating 6*        3,000¥  +[6] Capacity

*Cyberarm Gyromount      6,000¥  [8] Capacity Forbidden Legality*

This must be installed in a full or partial cyberarm. When activated, counterweights pop out of your wrist and a small gyro spins up to provide you with better balance and reduced recoil for improving your firing capability. Meanwhile, small children stare at you. It neutralises up to 3 points of recoil and movement modifiers. Activating or deactivating the system is a Use Device Action.

*Cyberfinger Light      50¥  [1] Capacity Legal*

A simple, small flashlight shining from the tip of your finger. Comes in low-light and infrared varieties and an assortments of colours.

*Cyberfinger Lighter      50¥  [1] Capacity Legal*

Good for lighting cigarettes… or fuses.

*Cyberholster       2,000¥  [5] Capacity Restricted Legality*

You can hold a taser or any pistol- or smaller-sized weapon within the holster, completely enclosed until you activate it. A cyberholster can also be used as a smuggling compartment to store items no larger than a pistol.

*Cyberskates (pair)      500¥  [2] Capacity Legal*

A simple modification where retractable skates are placed in the user’s cyberfeet, these are virtually useless unless taken in pairs. When engaged, the user’s walking and running speeds are improved by fifty percent, but the unsteady balance results in a lowering of their Physical limit by 1 while the skates are in use. Activating or deactivating the skates is a Use Device Action.

*Grapple Hand       2,000¥  [10] Capacity Restricted Legality*

A modification to a cyberarm (either partial or full) that consists of a winch, a feed system capable of loading up to thirty meters of wire and a pneumatic launcher that can fire the cyberhand up to the full range of wire, which also serves as a command path to let the hand grab hold of a distant target. Once a firm grip is secured, the winch can pull them toward the hand at the rate of ten metres per Combat Turn or half that silently. Should a grip not be made, it can rewind the hand at a rate of twenty-five metres per turn or ten metres silently. It takes one minute for the air compressor to ready the hand for another shot.

Use Exotic Ranged Weapon (Grapple Gun) for targeting with the launched hand.

Grapple Fist Accuracy 4 7S AP-2 SS RC -

*Hydraulic Jacks (pair)*

*Rating 1*        2,500¥  [1] Capacity Legal

*Rating 2*        5,000¥  [2] Capacity Legal

*Rating 3*        7,500¥  [3] Capacity Legal

*Rating 4*        10,000¥  [4] Capacity Legal

*Rating 5*        12,500¥  [5] Capacity Legal

*Rating 6*        15,000¥  [6] Capacity Legal

This implants requires you to have two cyberlegs with a hydraulic jack of identical Ratings in each leg. Each Rating point adds +1 to your Physical limit and dice pool for jumping and sprinting, as well as adding twenty percent to your maximum jump distance and reducing your falling distance by two metres for the purpose of calculating falling damage.

*Skimmers (pair)       4,000¥  [4] Capacity Legal*

A more complex option for cyberfeet is the use of ground-effect platforms, based on skimmer drone technology, to provide a cushion of air beneath the user and allow them to hover a few centimetres above the ground. It takes some practice to get the hang of it, but once mastered, the skimmers allow the user to move at double their normal walking or running speed when engaged. The fragile balance required to manoeuvre them reduces the user’s Physical limit by 2 for such actions. Note that these are completely useless unless taken in pairs and they’re unusable if the user attempts to carry any significant extra weight. Activating or deactivating the skates is a Use Device Action.

#### **Cyber Implant Weapons**

Cyber-implant weapons can be installed into cyberlimbs or directly into the meat. They’re popular with the denizens of urban wastelands like the Barrens and with street samurai who never want to go anywhere unarmed.

*Cyberguns           Restricted Legality*

Generally speaking, these are mounted in a cyberarm, but you could install one in a leg or even your torso. Cyberguns are distinct from cyberholsters in that the gun itself can be controlled and fired directly, as an extension of your body. Depending on the size of the gun, cyberguns take up part of your forearm or replace your arm altogether, with the functional parts of the arm built around the gun. Smaller cyberguns fire through a hidden port in the palm or knuckles, while larger cyberguns fold back the user’s hand at the wrist. All cyberguns come pre-equipped with smartgun systems. All cyberguns have internal magazines (m) and can be equipped with a hidden external ammo port. However, once you attack a clip to the side of your forearm or the back of your elbow, the cybergun becomes kind of obvious.

*Hold-out Pistol Acc 4 (6) 2(m) DV 6P RC - AP - SA* 2,000¥  [2] Capacity

*Light Pistol Acc 6 (8) 10(m) DV 7P RC - AP - SA* 4,000¥  [4] Capacity

*Machine Pistol* *Acc 4 (6) 18(m) DV 6P RC 1 AP - SA/BF* 3,500¥  [6] Capacity

*External Clip Port**       1,000¥  [1] Capacity

*Silencer/Suppressor*      1,000¥  [2] Capacity

*Foot Blade (Retractable) DV (STR+2)P AP -2  2,500¥  0.2 Ess/2 Cap Forbidden Legality*

This modification implants a retractable blade into the foot which can be used to deliver devastating kick attacks. Most commonly, the blade comes from the front of the foot or the heel.

*Hand Blade (Retractable) DV (STR+2)P AP -2  2,500¥  0.2 Ess/2 Cap Forbidden Legality*

Hand blades slip out the side of the hand, opposite the thumb, parallel to the hand, and while they are universally thin and sharp, they come in a variety of shapes and styles.

*Hand Razors (Retractable) DV (STR+1)P AP -3  1,250¥  0.2 Ess/2 Cap Forbidden Legality*

Hand razors are blades two to three centimetres long, made of chromed steel or carbon fibre. They either slide out from beneath your fingernails or replace them entirely.

*Shock Hand  DV 9S(e) AP -5  5,000¥  0.25 Ess/4 Cap Restricted Legality*

The shock hand is like a shock glove built into the palm of your hand, perfect for inflicting a nasty shock to anything it comes into contact with. Shock hands deal electricity damage and have ten charges in each hard; when plugged in they recharge at a rate of one charge per ten seconds.

*Spurs (Retractable)  DV (STR+3)P AP-2  5,000¥  0.3 Ess/3 Cap Forbidden Legality*

Spurs are one to four blades or spikes protruding from the back of your wrist or your knuckles, sticking out from your fist as much as thirty centimetres.  

### **Bioware**

Bioware is subtler, more holistic and less invasive than cyberware, at the cost of being substantially pricer. Instead of replacing body parts with machines, bioware augments the body’s own functions and integrates transplanted organs that function as natural features. The application of biotechnology is a tricky business, as the fine balance of homeostasis between the body’s organic systems must be maintained. In the last decade, bionics and bio-engineering techniques have taken bioware from cutting edge to commonplace. Bioware is more expensive monetarily, costs less Essence and is much harder to spot. Also – and we’d like to think this goes without saying – bioware has no wireless capability at all.

#### **Basic Bioware**

*Bilateral Coordination Co-Processor    4,500¥  0.2 Essence Legal*

The BCC is a small amount of specialised brain tissue added to the corpus collosum, which balances dexterity between the left and right portions of the body. This augmentation negates 2 points of penalties for using your off hand.

*[Alphaware] BBCA*      5,400¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Biosculpted Ear Points      250¥  0.05 Essence Legal*

Purely cosmetic, ear points can be removed and smoothed down or added and raised to points.

*Bone Density Augmentation*

*Rating 1*    Damage (STR) P   5,000¥  0.3 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*    Damage (STR +1) P  10,000¥  0.6 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*    Damage (STR +2) P  15,000¥  0.9 Essence Legal

The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase the density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened and the increased bone density increases your weight a bit. Your Body attribute is increased by the bone density Rating for the purpose of Damage Resistance Tests. You also deal Physical damage in unarmed combat, based on the Rating of the augmentation. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to the bones, including bone lacing cyberware.

*[Alphaware] Bone Density Augmentation (Rating 3)*  18,000¥  0.72 Essence Legal

*Cat’s Eyes       4,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vision, providing low-light vision. Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyberware eye enhancements or replacements.

*[Alphaware] Tiger’s Eyes*     4,800¥  0.08 Essence Legal

*Dietware       1,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

Dietware consists of one of several modifications to the stomach and digestive tract that inhibits the digestion and absorption of food, especially carbohydrates and fat. This keeps the user slender against all but the most gluttonous of appetites.

*\*A quick reminder that food ingested but not processed has to go **somewhere**. Half star, don’t recommend.*

*Enhanced Articulation      24,000¥  0.3 Essence Legal*

A number of procedures like joint-surface coating, re-lubrication and tendon and ligament augmentation lead to more fluid muscle and joint action. Enhanced articulation provides you with a +1 dice pool bonus to Acrobatics Tests and a +1 increase to your Physical limit (cumulative with other limit modifiers).

*[Alphaware] Expert Articulation*    28,800¥  0.24 Essence Legal

*Expanded Volume          Legal*

*Rating 1*        2,000¥  0.1 Essence

*Rating 2*        4,000¥  0.2 Essence

*Rating 3*        6,000¥  0.3 Essence

The amount of air exchanged in each breath a metahuman takes is about half a litre; this is known as the tidal volume. By expanding the tidal volume of each breath, the lungs, which hold five times that much air, become more efficient in oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange and improve the user’s overall endurance. The user may add this bioware’s Rating to dice pools for all Fatigue Tests.

*[Alphaware] Expanded Volume (Rating 3)*   7,200¥  0.24 Essence Legal

*Gills        24,000¥  0.3 Essence Legal*

Set into the sides of the user’s neck, gills ensure the user no longer has to worry about drowning. A user with gills can breathe water (either fresh or salt, chosen when first installed).

*[Alphaware] Gills*      28,800¥  0.24 Essence Legal

*Hand and Foot Webbing     1,000¥  0.05 Essence Legal*

A simple implantation, usually added in pairs, adding webbing between the user’s toes or fingers, which are expanded by simple muscle contraction and withdrawn the same way (each is a Bonus Action), allowing the user improved speed while swimming.

For each hand or foot that has webbing engaged, the user gains +1 to their Physical limit for Swimming tests, while each matched pair adds +1 to the swimmer’s speed multiplier. When webbing is engaged on a user’s hands, they suffer a -1 penalty to their Physical limit for any actions that include fine manipulation.

*[Alphaware] Hand and Foot Webbing*    1,200¥  0.04 Essence Legal

*Muscle Augmentation*

*Rating 1*        31,000¥  0.2 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*        62,000¥  0.4 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*        93,000¥  0.6 Essence Restricted Licence

This biological weaving treatment enhances existing muscle tissue, rather than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are woven into existing muscle fibres, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your Strength. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Strength, including the muscle replacement cyberware.

*[Alphaware] Muscle Augmentation (Rating 3)*   111,600¥  0.48 Essence Restricted Licence

*Muscle Toner*

*Rating 1*        32,000¥  0.2 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*        64,000¥  0.4 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*        99,000¥  0.6 Essence Restricted Licence

This treatment increases muscle fibre elasticity in existing muscle tension, resulting in increased muscle tension and flexibility while providing a smooth and ropy physique. Muscle toner adds its rating to your Agility. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Agility, including the muscle replacements cyberware.

*[Alphaware] Muscle Toner (Rating 3)*    118,800¥  0.48 Essence Restricted Licence

*Nictitating Membrane      1,000¥  0.05 Essence Legal*

A simple transparent “third eyelid” that keeps the eye moist and protects it from damage by assorted irritants, the nictitating membrane is similar to that possessed by several animals, most notably reptiles and sharks. Unlike normal eyelids, the nictitating membrane slides horizontally and is somewhat unsettling to see as most mammals, including metahumans, don’t possess such a feature. It’s useful in diving, to keep floating detritus from damaging the eye itself but also on land for brushing away smoke or grit. A tinted version is available to act as a defence against bright light, but this version cannot be seen through clearly, resulting in an either-or proposition that few use. Note that nictitating membranes are not compatible with cybereyes.

Standard nictitating membranes add a +2 dice pool modifier to resist eye irritants, such as CS gas or pepper spray, as well as ordinary smoke, plus allow the user to keep their eyes open underwater without discomfort.

Tinted versions give similar benefits and further act as flare compensation when engaged but provide a -1 dice pool penalty to Perception Tests using vision.

*[Alphaware] Nictitating Membrane*    1,200¥  0.04 Essence Legal

*Orthoskin*

*Rating 1*        6,000¥  0.25 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*        12,000¥  0.5 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*        18,000¥  0.75 Essence Restricted Licence

A web of biofibres in the skin provides the equivalent of personal armour while being virtually indistinguishable from natural skin. Orthoskin adds its Rating to your Armour Rating and is cumulative with other Armour. Orthoskin cannot be combined with skin augmentations that give you Armour, including dermal plating.

*[Alphaware] Orthoskin (Rating 3)*    22,000¥  0.6 Essence Restricted Licence

*Orthoskin, Dragon Hide*

*Rating 1 [Alphaware]*      9,500¥  0.28 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 3 [Alphaware]*      24,000¥  0.68 Essence Restricted Licence

While many expect this mod to involve scales, that would be a simple cosmetic modification unconnected to the actual upgrade. Dragon Hide weaves flame-retardant materials into the orthoskin, which distributes thermal impact, prevents blistering and reduces overall burning as energy dissipates across the larger surface.

In addition to the standard benefits of orthoskin, the user gains +2 Body for resisting fire damage, but also has a -2 dice pool penalty on Perception Tests involving ambient or tactile heat detection.

*Orthoskin, Penguin Blubber*

*Rating 1 [Alphaware]*      9,500¥  0.28 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 3 [Alphaware]*      24,000¥  0.68 Essence Restricted Licence

Thicker than normal orthoskin, penguin blubber produces a protective oil that prevents the skin from drying and cracking in sub-freezing temperatures while protecting internal organs against the cold. It also gives the user a somewhat tubby look. Users with penguin blubber can happily frolic barefoot on snow or take a dip in freezing water, enjoying temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius without long-term effect. Adding insulating material over this can result in a toasty-warm explorer in even the harshest Antarctic temperatures.

In addition to the standard benefits of orthoskin, the user gains +2 Body for resisting cold damage and can quintuple the time exposed to harsh cold environs for purposes of Fatigue damage.

*Orthoskin, Sealskin*

*Rating 1 [Alphaware]*      9,500¥  0.28 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 3 [Alphaware]*      24,000¥  0.68 Essence Restricted Licence

This skin is coated with naturally refreshing water-repelling oils that allow the user to cut through the waves with ease. The user’s skin retains a somewhat moist appearance at all times.

In addition to the standard benefits of orthoskin, remove all penalties associated with moving through water, allowing the user to operate underwater as easily as in air. Note that this does not include either water breathing functionality or swimming ability (those are sold separately).

*Platelet Factories      17,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal*

Platelet factories increase your body’s ability to handle Physical damage by accelerating the production of platelets within bone marrow and their concentration in the blood, which helps stop bleeding faster. Any time you would take 2 or more boxes of damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, reduce the damage by one box.

*[Alphaware] Platelet Complex*    20,000¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Quills        2,500¥  0.25 Essence Legal*

A quick transplant and a hormonal and retroviral cocktail are all that are needed to replace select follicles with tough, needle-like spines similar to a hedgehog’s. Each transplant procedure covers the surface area of a limb (e.g. an arm, a leg, the torso, the head). Individual quills are hollow and have a length of 2-4 centimetres. The quills can be wielding in melee combat using the Exotic Melee Weapon (Quills) skill. (STR+1)P, Reach -, AP+1.

*Synthacardium*

*Rating 1*        30,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        60,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        90,000¥  0.3 Essence Legal

Artificially enhanced myocardium allows cardiovascular functions to be performed more efficiently, enabling the heart to keep the blood better oxygenated. The synthacardium adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus to your tests using skills in the Athletics skill group.

*[Alphaware] Synthcardium (Rating 3)*    110,000¥  0.24 Essence Legal

*Tail        2,000¥  0.25 Essence Legal*

The standard bioware tail is grafted directly to the user’s spinal column, allowing for natural-feeling use. Natural tails tend to react to subconscious thoughts, giving away the user’s emotional state, otherwise idly swaying a bit when the individual it not paying attention. Ordinary tails are available in lengths of up to one metre, with textured fur or scales being a common modification and quietly serve as extra balance.

*Toxin Extractor Liver*

*Rating 1*        5,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        10,000¥  0.4 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        15,000¥  0.6 Essence Legal

*Rating 4*        20,000¥  0.8 Essence Legal

A specially cultivated cluster of cells in your liver improves its filtering capabilities. The toxin extractor adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus to all your Toxin Resistance Tests.

*[Alphaware] Toxin Extractor Liver (Rating 4)*   24,000¥  0.64 Essence Legal

*Tracheal Filter*

*Rating 1*        4,500¥  0.1 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        9,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        13,500¥  0.3 Essence Legal

*Rating 4*        18,000¥  0.4 Essence Legal

Implanted at the top of your trachea, this organ can absorb airborne impurities and keep them from reaching your lungs. The filter adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus to Toxin Resistance Tests against inhalation vector toxins.

*[Alphaware] Tracheal Filter (Rating 4)*    22,000¥  0.32 Essence Legal

*Tusks, Medium       500¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

All the rage during the big Orksploitation craze, tusks continue to be sought by ork posers worldwide and, quietly, are purchased by orks who have lost their own tusks due to mistreatment or combat. Note that replacing a broken tusk costs an ork no Essence.

#### **Cultured Bioware**

Cultured bioware must be tailor-made for the body in which it will eventually find a home. This means it is more expensive and takes longer to acquire than the off-the-shelf-kind.

*Cerebellum Booster*

*Rating 1*        50,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

This one’s a sort of Holy Grail for neuro-amplification. While the cerebral booster’s been established for twenty years, increasing the user’s instinctive nature has eluded researchers. It was a breakthrough in Aztechnology’s research that finally found the key; rather than a focus on the hindbrain, the right target was in the cerebellum. With careful amplification of the lateral cerebellum, the inception of movement and absorption of sensory data can be sped up, resulting in a more intuitive response to external stimuli and an improved joining of thought to action in an expressive sense. That is to say, it makes the user more instinctive and able to respond to stimuli without those pesky higher-functions needing to be involved.

The cerebellum booster increases the user’s Intuition attribute by its Rating.

*[Alphaware] Cerebellum Booster (Rating 1)*   60,000¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Cerebral Booster*

*Rating 1*        31,500¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        63,000¥  0.4 Essence Legal

The convolutions and gyri of your cerebrum are augmented and amplified with additional nervous tissue, improving overall brain function. Your cerebral booster increases your Logic attribute by its Rating.

*[Alphaware] Cerebral Booster (Rating 1)*   37,500¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*[Alphaware] Cerebral Booster (Rating 2)*   75,000¥  0.32 Essence Legal

*Clean Metabolism      1,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal*

With a series of alterations to the recipient’s exocrine glands, liver and pancreas – and the addition of tailored bacteria to the intestines – this bioware more efficiently digests food and drink. The main effect, however, is that most of the more embarrassing and unpleasant effects of the digestive system are eliminated. Users rarely develop body odour, belch or pass wind. Even the person’s sweat and bodily waste are sanitised. This treatment is popular among high-society players and trendy types who wish to avoid a social faux pas.

*[Alphaware] Sanitised Metabolism*    1,200¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Damage Compensator*

*Rating 1*        2,000¥  0.1 Essence Forbidden Legality

*Rating 2*        4,000¥  0.2 Essence Forbidden Legality

*Rating 3*        6,000¥  0.3 Essence Forbidden Legality

*Rating 4*        8,000¥  0.4 Essence Forbidden Legality

Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun or a combination of the two) equal to the compensator’s Rating before determining your injury modifiers.

*[Alphaware] Damage Compensator (Rating 4)*   10,000¥  0.32 Essence Forbidden Legality

*Mnemonic Enhancer*

*Rating 1*        9,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        18,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

This highly concentrated growth of grey matter gets attached to the brain’s memory centres, improving both short- and long-term memory. Add the enhancer’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to your Knowledge, Language and memory-related tests as well as your Mental Limit.

*[Alphaware] Mnemonic Enhancer (Rating 1)*   11,000¥  0.08 Essence Legal

*[Alphaware] Mnemonic Enhancer (Rating 2)*   22,000¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Reception Enhancer      10,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal*

Reception enhancers were a happy accident, a result of twenty years of looking for what would eventually become the cerebellum booster. The reaction enhancer is an improvement in the data-processing and observation sections of the brain, allowing the user to handle multiple sources of data without being overwhelmed, a key development in dealing with the modern world’s non-stop assault via advertising. But cutting away all the distractions, the user can focus on what’s important. Like the ads. The user ignores distractions and interfering sight/sound/odour modifiers for Perception Tests.

*[Alphaware] Reception Enhancer*    12,000¥  0.16 Essence Legal

*Sleep Regulator       12,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal*

The sleep regulator is a modification to the hypothalamus, allowing for longer periods of wakefulness, an incredibly useful advantage for anyone with any profession, not just shadowrunners. You need less sleep per day and the sleep you get is deep and restful (and harder to wake you up from). The sleep regulator lets you get by with three hours of sleep each night and stay awake for twice as long as normal before having to resist sleep deprivation fatigue. Resting hours for healing purposes are not affected.

*[Alphaware] Sleep Regulator*     15,000¥  0.08 Essence Legal

*Synaptic Booster*

*Rating 1*        95,000¥  0.5 Essence Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*        190,000¥  1 Essence  Restricted Licence

The nerve cells making up the spinal cord are both broadened and replicated with this bioware, allowing for more neural bandwidth. The result is a much faster reaction time. The booster confers a bonus of +1 Reaction (and accompanying bonus to Initiative and Physical limit) and +1D6 Initiative Die per point of Rating. The synaptic booster cannot be combined with other forms of Reaction enhancement.

*[Alphaware] Synaptic Booster (Rating 1)*   114,000¥  0.4 Essence Restricted Licence

*[Alphaware] Synaptic Booster (Rating 2)*   228,000¥  0.8 Essence Restricted Licence

*Trauma Damper*

*Rating 1*        4,000¥  0.1 Essence Legal

*Rating 2*        8,000¥  0.2 Essence Legal

*Rating 3*        12,000¥  0.3 Essence Legal

Somewhat misnamed as it doesn’t actually reduce physical damage so much as make the user blissfully resistant to pain, the trauma damper is a series of pain receptors added to the base of the thalamus with one job: crank out endorphins in response to negative stimuli, such as pain or fatigue. In effect, the user experiences a “runner’s high” that counteracts some of the pain while leaving the mind somewhat foggy. There’s a small bio-hack that can keep the user in a constant low level of pain, forcing the body to keep producing endorphins 24/7. Not recommended, but ‘dorphs can be found in many communities.

The trauma damper reduces the user’s Damage Modifier by up to its Rating, but when doing so it reduces the user’s limits and Reaction by a matching amount.

|4/5|3/4|1|5|5|1|1|1|

This is a durable off-road bike used in motocross and other extreme sports events, usually seen in photos and footage with both the bike and its rider covered in dust. It’s popular with thrill seekers, wilderness buffs and light-freight drug smugglers.

*Standard Upgrades:* Off-road Suspension

*Suzuki Mirage        8,500¥ Legal*

|4/3|4|2|8|9|1|2|1|

This bike is a classic, heavy-bodied, heavily chromed road hog, armoured and styled for intimidation. Very popular with a certain type of go-ganger and with big, tough orks and trolls who don’t worry about little things like “embodying a cliché”. This bike is even tough enough to be used in the combat biking circuit.

*Standard Upgrades:* Metahuman adjustment (troll)

### **Cars**

Cars are operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill. Most come available with either electric or hybrid bio-fuel engines.

*Chrysler-Nissan Jackrabbit      10,000¥ Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/3|3|2|8|4|1|2|2|

This cheap, ubiquitous electric subcompact was made in North America for decades. Even after North American production ceased, dozens of generic rip-offs were contract produced throughout the third world. The sheer amount of Chrysler-Nissan Jackrabbits on the road means the older model must continue to be supported.

*Ford Americar       16,000¥ Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Seats**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/3|3|2|11|6|1|2|4|

This four-door sedan has an affordable price point, capacious luggage storage and safety features that, combined, made it the bestselling family car in North America for decades before losing out to the Mercury Comet. The Americar is reliable and economical, but not fast or sexy. If you need to ferry four metahumans from point a to point B, a Ford Americar is probably the most straightforward and anonymous way to do so. It’s not flashy and it’s not stylish but sometimes flashy gets you killed.

*Mercury Comet       20,000¥ Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Seats**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/4|3|2|11|6|2|2|4|

The 2073 model marks the return of the Comet, a sedan for every occasion. Ford/Ares is marketing this as the average car with unlimited potential. This isn’t like the Chameleon or the Sin-Hyang with aftermarket tuning – the Comet has been designed with interchangeable body panels to make this a car for everyone. Styles and colours galore fit any taste. Every exterior panel on the Comet can be easily switched out and changing all the panels takes only about a half hour. Versatility around a rather robust crash cage has put this new offering in plenty of garages.

*Hyundai Shin-Hyung       28,500¥ Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Seats**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|5/4|6|3|10|6|1|2|4|

This cheap four-door sports sedan is a fast, powerful car for corp youth to show off their moxie to their friends in a socially acceptable and constructive way. Available for low prices out of the box, the Shin-Hyung is often heavily customised by tuners and street racing enthusiasts to the point of being far more functional and barely recognisable. The Shin-Hyung can be bought cheap, goes fast and handles well. What else could you want? These facts have made it popular with Triad and Yakuza elements as well as more affluent street gangs and slumming rich kids.

*Standard Upgrades:* Four extra Body Modification Slots

*Ferrari Diabolus       110,000¥ Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|6/4|7|3|10|8|3|5|2|

This sleek, classic, low-slung speed machine mixes business and pleasure into perfection. Situated perfectly at the intersection of luxury and performance, this is a turbo-charged sportscar that is only a pipe dream for most slags working their way up through the shadows. Its sexy lines and powerful engine make it consistently powerful among muscle car enthusiasts.

*Standard Upgrades:* Anti-Theft System (Rating 2), Passenger Protections System (Rating 6)

*SK-Bentley Concordat      65,000¥ Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|5/4|5|2|12|12|2|4|4|

This luxury sedan is stylish, stately and impressive. It is fast and powerful, comfortable and safe, opulently appointed and, most importantly, a status symbol. The SK-Bentley Concordat is the kind of car that simstars and orxploitation rappers drive; a runner behind the wheel of one has made the big time indeed. Either that or they stole it.

*Mitsubishi Nightsky       320,000¥ Legal*

Decadent, secure and high-tech, this armoured limousine isn’t for you. It’s for corp executives, media stars and Mr Johnson; only in their company will you enjoy its spacious interior and luxurious amenities.

*Standard Upgrades:* Amenities (Luxury), Life Support (Level 1)

### **Trucks and Vans**

Trucks and vans are operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill. Most come available with either electric or hybrid bio-fuel engines.

*Toyota Gopher       25,000¥ Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|5/5|4|2|14|10|1|2|3|

This is a classic pickup with great off-road suspension, superior handling and a loyal customer base. This low-maintenance design is a bit dated but sees widespread use in third world nations and rural areas, especially the NAN. It’s not the most wiz thing you could drive, although its powerful engine and storage space could certainly come in handy if you have some heavy duty hauling to do.

*Standard Upgrades:* Off-Road Suspension, Special Equipment (Open Box Storage)

*GMC Bulldog        35,000¥ Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3/3|3|1|16|12|1|2|6|

This long-running top seller from GM is a capacious (and armoured!) delivery van favoured by everybody from legitimate shipping and logistics companies to security agencies to heavy mob crews to shadowrunners. It has lots of room for people, gear or whatever you need to move, plus an engine and chassis that can take a ton of punishment and keep on running.

*Standard Upgrades:* Four extra Body Modification Slots

*Ares Chuck Wagon       40,000¥ Legal*

A rigger’s got to eat, right? One way to have food where you need it is to make it look like you’re there to serve food while you’re actually spying on local corporate traffic. This mobile food-service truck, usually referred to as a food truck or, much less politely, a roach coach, provides facilities for a variety of food-related activities. Trucks come in three varieties: prepared food, unprepared food and frozen treats. Prepared food trucks offer things like ice cream, chips, sodas and prepackaged sandwiches. Inside, they’re set up with a large storage unit that can be specialised as a freezer and/or refrigerator, along with some heating element for food served warm. Unprepared food trucks offer a limited menu of items usually centred around a certain theme. Inside, they have a slightly smaller cold storage area and heating element, along with a sink, sanitation facility and prep area. Frozen treat trucks serve the standard frozen pops of every kind, with specialised ones offering scooped ice cream. The back is nothing but freezer space.

The Ares Chuck Wagon is the premier roach coach because it has windows on both sides to increase service speed. Since seating isn’t a high priority, the front area includes the driver’s seat and one fold-down jump seat. The Chuck Wagon is not a race truck by any means but at least the ride is smooth and the food is plentiful. If you stock it, of course.

*Ares Roadmaster       52,000¥ Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Seats**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3/3|3|1|18|18|3|3|8|

This is a fragging armoured car, chummer, and you should be grateful you can buy it legally. Legitimately used to move goods over lands that need secure transportation, the Roadmaster may have the speed and handling of the tank that it is and it may be anything but subtle but it can reliably shrug off small arms fire and even grenades. For many teams, that’s a worthwhile tradeoff.

### **Vehicle Modifications**

Runners who use their vehicles day in and day out to pull their jobs rarely want to keep them as they are off the shelf. In the highly competitive world of shadowrunning, runners need to get every edge they can to avoid winding up dead. Unless otherwise stated, a modification may only be taken once for a vehicle. When a vehicle stat such as Speed or Acceleration is listed as part of a modification attribute (like cost), use the vehicle’s base or *unmodified* value in the calculation. In the case of Handling, which has two values, always use the *higher* value in any calculations.

Every vehicle has a certain number of *Modification Slots* that determine how much extra stuff can be packed into the vehicle. Each vehicle modification has a number of Modification Slots equal to its Body in ***each Modification Category***. There are six Modification Categories: Body, Electromagnetic, Power Train, Protection, Weapons and Cosmetic.

So, a GMC Bulldog with a Body of 16 has 16 Modification Slots in each of the six categories. Modifications only take up the slots for their category. A vehicle cannot exceed its Modification Slots in any category. Not even a little.

### **Vehicle Equipment**

The following are not considered modifications to the vehicle since they do not integrate into the systems of the vehicle in a significant way. They are standard pieces of equipment that can be purchased and easily installed or used.

*Morphing Licence Plate        1,000¥ Forbidden Legality*

While most modern governments primarily use electronic identification for vehicles, they still require some sort of physical identification plate to uniquely identify a vehicle. Since being positively identified is something that an average shadowrunner wants to avoid, most install a special morphing licence plate. Made from smart materials, a morphing licence plate can reshape itself with a Complex Action and mimic any of the forms used in governments around the world today.

*Spoof Chip         500¥ Forbidden Legality*

Governments in the civilised world require that a vehicle be uniquely tagged and broadcast that identification on demand. This allows law enforcement and any authorised government agency (and some unauthorised) to quickly identify and track a vehicle. All of that may sound great to the common wageslave but those are all things that a shadowrunner wants to avoid like a VITAS plague. Consequently, installing a spoof chip has become a common practice for anyone wanted to use a vehicle for their shadow activities. The spoof chip mimics a standard vehicle identifier chip but can be commanded with a Complex Action to change its identifier to a different random value that is arithmetically generated to appear authentic. Installing a spoof chip requires a Hardware + Logic [Logic] (2) Test.

*Tyres, Off-Road         400¥/tyre Legal*

Designed specifically for rough terrain, these tyres are not as effective as standard tyres on standard roads. When equipped, the vehicle’s off-road Handling is increased by +1 and on-road Handling is reduced by -1. Off-road tyres are also considered to be run flat tyres (see below).

*Tyres, Racing         250¥/tyre Legal*

The flip-side of off-road tyres, racing tyres are designed to maximise vehicle performance in urban conditions. When equipped, the vehicle’s on-road Handling is increased by +1 and off-road Handling is reduced by -1.

*Tyres, Run Flat         250¥/tyre Legal*

A common upgrade for shadowrunners, run flat tires are filled with a dense but flexible foam instead of air. They continue to operate even when the tire has been punctured but will quickly deteriorate if the tire suffers significant structure damage.

#### **Body**

Body modifications modify the hull or structure of the vehicle in some form.

*Chameleon Coating  2 Mod Slots    Body x 1,000¥ Forbidden Legality*

Not just for the flighty owner who can’t settle on a paint colour for their vehicle, chameleon coating is an essential tool for keeping a vehicle used for shadow activities inconspicuous. A vehicle with the coating has its exterior hull covered in a specialised kind of polymer that allows it to display any kind of image sent to the system with an electronic signal. This can be as simple as changing the colour of the vehicle or as complex as covering it in moving advertisements and video. Changing the output of the coasting is a Bonus Action. Particularly clever riggers have linked the video feed from their external sensors into the system so that the exterior of the vehicle mimics the environment around it, resulting in a crude (but effective) “cloaking” or blending system. When running in this mode, as long as it is not moving faster than its Walking rate, Perception Tests made to find the vehicle suffer a -3 dice pool penalty.

*Ejection Seats   1 Mod Slot each     750¥ Restricted Licence*

Remember that time when there was an annoying passenger in the back and you wished you could just push a button and fire them out of the vehicle? Well, with ejection seats you can! Using a simple expanding has propulsion system, activated remotely with a Use Device Action, any seat in the vehicle can become a means to eject the occupant of that seat. Seats can be equipped with parachutes if the system is being used for safe egress of someone that you want to be whole when they land or without if not. Traditionally, ejection seats launch vertically upward but they can be configured to launch horizontally or even straight down (particularly vicious in aircraft or watercraft).

*Increased Seating  2 Mod Slots     2,000¥ Legal*

While no riggers like to be the “team mom” or the “runner taxi”, there are plenty of times that they will need to carry more people than their vehicle originally allowed, especially if they’re driving some super-slick European sports car that could only carry two to begin with. With increased seating, a vehicle can comfortably carry more passengers than its original design. This is far more than just jamming in a couple of extra people in – the modification includes all features for carrying people including comfortable (enough) seating, incorporating the vehicle’s safety systems (including PPS if installed) and other personal comfort features such as ventilation and lighting. This can mean rearranging the internal layout of the vehicle, extending it slightly or even adding “external” seating, such as a sidecar on a motorcycle. When this modification is taken, the passenger capacity of the vehicle is increased up to a fifty percent increase of its base value, though the gamesmaster has final say on exactly how many passengers the vehicle can reasonably carry.

*Smuggling Compartment 3 Mod Slots     1,500¥ Forbidden Legality*

You don’t need to run very long before you encounter a situation where you need to keep something (or someone) hidden from authorities that are trying to find it. In these situations, the smuggling compartment is what you need. This modification adds a storage compartment to the vehicle, one that is designed to not easily be found. In general, a smuggling compartment cannot be seen unless a person is specifically looking for hidden compartments or doing a thorough search of the vehicle and even in that case the Perception Test to notice the compartment is made with a -6 penalty. Smuggling compartments are hidden by purely visual means, so fi the contents of the compartment make it detectable by other means – chemical, radioactive, thermographic – these do not suffer a penalty. The gamesmaster determines if an object can fit in a smuggling compartment, based on the size of the vehicle. In general, smuggling compartments are about ten to twenty percent of the overall size of the vehicle itself.

*Shielding  0 Mod Slots       3,000¥ Forbidden Legality*

Compartments can have shielding installed on them to make the compartment difficult to detect by a particular non-visual sense. If this is done, then the -6 penalty applies to that sense as well. Shielding on a smuggling compartment may be taken multiple times, each time specifying a different sensory type (auditory, chemical, radioactive, astral, etc.).

*Winch           Legal*

For those times when a runner needs to pull or tow something and they don’t want to call an underpaid and overweight member of the auto club, there is the winch modification. A winch can be mounted on the front or rear of the vehicle and comes with about one hundred metres of cable and can support a load of up to ten tons, provided the vehicle itself it heavy enough to support this. If wirelessly enabled, the winch hook can be released remotely with a Use Device Action.

*Basic*  1 Mod Slot**     500¥ Legal

The basic winch hasn’t changed its design much in about a hundred years. It has a heavy gauge steel cable ending with a hook or latch and wraps around a powered drum.

*Enhanced*  2 Mod Slots**     4,000¥ Legal

An enhanced winch is generally found in heavy industrial or rescue vehicles but can be useful to a runner. Its winch replaces the hook with an advanced system using a combination of gecko-grip technology and magnetism that can attach to any surface on its target without the need to manually place a hook on an appropriate part. The system can be activated or deactivated with a wireless command (if enabled). The enhanced system can support a load of up to one hundred tons and includes additional stabilisers deployed from the vehicle and onto/into the ground to double the towing vehicle’s weight for lifting purposes.

#### **Electromagnetic**

Electromagnetic modifications are connected to or modify a vehicle’s electronic systems.

*Electromagnetic Shielding 2 Mod Slots    Body x 500¥ Restricted Licence*

When a rigger wants absolute control over the signals that come in and out of their vehicle, there isn’t a better option than the electromagnetic shielding modification. This system builds a system of conductive metal bands into the exterior body of the vehicle, designed to conduct away and dissipate all wireless signals that attempt to penetrate the body of the vehicle, going in or out. This modification only works on vehicles that create an enclosed space – it is useless for vehicles that are open, such as a motorcycle. In game terms, the body of the vehicle acts as a Faraday cage for Noise purposes meaning that no communication is possible through the barrier. When the system is installed, the owner can choose to have certain systems or features be able to move through the barrier by running a physical wire through the cage. Any device that can connect to the body of the vehicle with a wired connection can bypass the Faraday cage.

*Satellite Link    Mod Slot     500¥ Legal*

Want to have a drone keep tabs on your doss while you sit on a beach halfway across the world? You need a satellite link. Any vehicle equipped with this modification can uplink to communication satellites in low-Earth orbit, connecting to the Matrix from places where no local wireless networks exist. This link limits Noise due to distance to -5. Includes satellite dish.

*SunCell    2 Mod Slots    Body x 500¥ Legal*

For runners that are economically or environmentally minded, the SunCell modification provides a great option. Using powerful solar-energy collectors and a battery system, a vehicle can be powered by collecting solar energy. If operating exclusively during sunny daylight hours, a vehicle has unlimited operational time and needs no other fuel source. In any other conditions (where sunlight isn’t readily available), the vehicle will use up all power stored in the battery and then switch to its standard means of power production (likely a fossil-fuel engine). If operating in a mix of conditions, the SunCell system roughly doubles the operational time of the vehicle between refueling stops.

#### **Power Train**

Power train modifications all deal with how a vehicle is controlled and how the vehicle moves.

*Acceleration Enhancement        Legal*

*Rating 1*    4 Mod Slots*Accel x* 10,000¥ Legal

*Rating 2*    8 Mod Slots*Accel x* 25,000¥ Legal

Using a variety of techniques, like adding fuel accelerants (such as nitrous oxide), turbochargers, optimised intakes, afterburners or hydrofoil drives, the acceleration of a vehicle is increased. Due to inherent limitations in a vehicle’s design, its acceleration performance can only be increased so far. In the end, though, there’s nothing like going from zero to gone before you get shot. The Rating of the modification is added to the vehicle’s Acceleration value.

*Handling Enhancement         Legal*

*Rating 1*    4 Mod Slots*Handl x* 2,000¥ Legal

*Rating 2*    10 Mod Slots*Handl x* 5,000¥ Legal

*Rating 3*    18 Mod Slots*Handl x* 12,000¥ Legal

By adjusting the suspension and/or adjusting the workings of control systems, a vehicle can be made more responsive to manual or electronic controls. This can range from optimising control system response times to more dramatic changes like gyroscopic stabilisers or destabilising the structural integrity of the hull. Handling Enhancement can be taken with a Rating of 1 to 3, with the Rating added to the Handling (both on-road and off-road) of the vehicle.

*Improved Economy  2 Mod Slots     7,500¥ Legal*

With this modification, the fuel consumption of the vehicle has been optimised to use the minimum amount necessary for standard operation. Additionally, the vehicle is fitted with a variety of different means to gather operational power from the environment around it including sunlight, static electricity and wind. A vehicle with improved economy doubles its operational time as long as it is operating within normal parameters – no high speed chases.

*Multifuel Engine  4 Mod Slots    Body x 1,000¥ Legal*

For teams that frequently find themselves needing to travel far away from the comforts of modern civilisation, modifying a vehicle with a multifuel engine has proved invaluable. First, a portable plasma furnace is installed on the vehicle that can render small quantities of matter down to its constituent parts. Then, the vehicle’s engine is modified to be able to consume the raw material output of the plasma torch. This allows nearly any matter to be fed into the vehicle as fuel. A vehicle with a multifuel engine can always be refuelled as long as there is raw material around to be processed.

*Rigger Cocoon   4 Mod Slots    Body x 1,000¥ Legal*

For riggers, there is no safer place where they would leave their body than a rigger cocoon. Generally built into the driver’s seat of a vehicle, the cocoon is designed solely for the safety and comfort of someone who’s consciousness is going to be somewhere other than their body. The cocoon has ballistic cloth and hard armoured plating for physical protection, is fire resistant, has its own oxygen supply and carries a host of bio-med sensors to monitor the occupant’s condition. Additionally, the cocoon has a variety of safety systems to keep the occupant safe through the most extreme vehicle manoeuvres and even crashes. Getting into a rigger cocoon takes about a minute but it can be exited with a Complex Action using a quick-release system.

Treat the rigger cocoon as a barrier with an Armour of 12 and Structure of 8. The occupant of the rigger cocoon receives a +6 dice pool bonus to resist damage from crashes or other vehicle manoeuvres.

*Speed Enhancement         Legal*

*Rating 1*    5 Mod Slots*Speed x* 2,000¥ Legal

*Rating 2*    14 Mod Slots*Speed x* 5,000¥ Legal

*Rating 3*    20 Mod Slots*Speed x* 12,000¥ Legal

Using a variety of techniques and equipment (depending on the vehicle), including things such as superchargers, fuel distribution optimisation and parts replacement, the top speed of the vehicle is increased. More dramatic increases in top end speed require more extensive modifications to the vehicle as it is pushed far beyond its original design and limitations. Some designs can only be pushed so far. In the end, though, having that raw top-end speed can save your hoop. Speed Enhancement modification can be taken with a Rating of 1 to 3, with the Rating adding to the Speed attribute of the vehicle.

#### **Protection**

Protection modifications are all based around providing various defensive measures for the vehicle or its occupants.

*Anti-Theft System*

No self-respecting rigger wants to let their precious vehicle be stolen by some gutter punk with a screwdriver. The anti-theft system modification provides a variety of protection options, depending on the Rating.

*Rating 1*  1 Mod Slot**       500¥ Legal

Sensors are installed that detect unauthorised intrusion and alerts the owner with physical lights and sounds or sends an electronic message or both.

*Rating 2*  2 Mod Slots**       1,000¥ Legal

This includes the sensors from the previous level and adds the ability for the owner to remotely lockdown the vehicle, making it physically impossible to drive until the release code is sent by the owner. This system can be circumvented by decking the vehicle or mechanically disabling the fail safe with a Hardware + Logic [Logic] (4) Test.

*Rating 3*  4 Mod Slots**       2,500¥ Restricted Licence

With all of the previous features and the addition of an electro-shock system inflicting 9S(elec) or a gas release system equipped with a toxin of your choice.

` `*Rating 4*  6 Mod Slots**       5,000¥ Forbidden Legality

The final word in vehicle protection, it includes all of the previous level’s features and adds a remote triggered self-destruct option. The modified vehicle is reduced to medium-to-small component parts. The explosion has a base damage of 12P and -2 AP, with damage from the blast -2/m.

*Concealed Armour  3 Mod Slots/Rating   Rating x 3,000¥ Legal*

Concealed vehicle armour is installed in such a way as to be noticeable only to a trained observer (Perception (4) Test) but does not allow nearly as much protection to be installed. Each point taken for this modification adds a point to the vehicle’s Armour Value for Damage Resistance Tests. The most armour any vehicle can add is equal to the vehicle’s Body. This is true even if there are remaining modification slots on the vehicle.

*Passenger Protection System (PPS) 2 Mod Slots   Rating x 2,000¥ Legal*

The passenger protection system (PPS) is a well known and trusted series of systems and modifications made to a vehicle to keep its passengers safe in case of a collision or other “adverse vehicular situations”. PPS components include four-point harnesses, padded surfaces, quick-deploying air bags and, in some cases, fast-drying foam. A PPS has a Rating of 1 to 6, with the Rating added as a dice pool bonus to any Damage Resistance Tests by passengers from damage due to crashes or any other vehicular activity (including ramming) that is not an attack by a weapon.

#### **Weapons**

*Ammo Bins    1 Mod Slot   200¥ Restricted Licence*

Are you one of those runners that feel that any problem can be solved with enough bullets? Is “spray and pray” your personal street proverb? Then you probably want the ammo bin modification. Each ammo bin modification provides an extra 250 rounds of ammunition for one of the vehicle’s weapon mounts. The modification may be taken multiple times, providing more rounds for different weapons or even multiple times for the same weapon (if you really need a *lot* of bullets).

*Drone Rack    \* Mod Slot*

A drone rack is an indispensable tool for a rigger who relies on drones to accomplish critical tasks for their team. Drone racks consist of a metal framework or harness designed to allow for quick and easy deployment of a drone in an instant, turning a vehicle equipped with several of them into a powerful, multipurpose drone carrier. Any drone carried in any kind of drone rack can be deployed by spending a Simple Action. Each drone rack can carry a single drone of a maximum size depending on the size of the rack. Additionally, each drone rack can be standard or landing type.

All **standard** drone racks deploy drones as above but require a manual process to re-embark the drone. This involves physically putting the drone back into the rack, a process that takes 2 rounds per size category of the drone.

**Landing** drones racks have a mechanic or electromagnetic grapple system that can automatically re-embark a drone that is directly beneath or adjacent to them with a Complex Action. This can even be done while the vehicle is in motion, as long as the target drone can match the vehicle’s speed.

**Micro** drone racks can hold up to ten micro drones. **Mini** drone racks can carry one drone of up to Mini size. **Small** drone racks can carry one drone of up to Small size. **Medium** drones racks can carry one drone of up to Medium size. **Large** drone racks can carry one drone of up to Large size.

|**Drone Racks**|**Slots**|**¥**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Micro – Standard**|1|350¥|
|**Micro – Landing**|2|750¥|
|**Mini – Standard**|1|500¥|
|**Mini – Landing**|2|1,000¥|
|**Small – Standard**|2|1,000¥|
|**Small – Landing**|3|4,000¥|
|**Medium – Standard**|3|2,000¥|
|**Medium – Landing**|4|10,000¥|
|**Large – Standard**|4|4,000¥|
|**Large – Landing**|5|20,000¥|

*Gun Port    1 Mod Slot    500¥ Restricted Licence*

For those times when you want your vehicle to be less “car” and more “armoured personnel carrier”, there is the gun port mod. A gun port is a small flap or slot installed strategically in the hull of the vehicle that allows a single passenger (or the driver, if you can multitask) to shoot a hand-held weapon at a target outside the vehicle, while staying completely protected by the vehicle’s armour. The port provides a ninety-degree cone of visibility and a small stability harness that provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation. The gun port mod can be taken as many times as possible for the vehicle, through it provides no benefit beyond the amount of passengers that a vehicle can reasonably carry.

*Oil Slick Sprayer   1 Mod Slot    200¥ Restricted Licence*

Some runners say that old tricks are the best tricks and they’re the ones who most love the simple but effective oil slick sprayer. Using a few nozzles and a reservoir of slick fluid, the ground immediately behind the vehicle can be made extremely hazardous to pursuing ground-based vehicles. Activating the oil slick sprayer is a Bonus Action; following activation, any ground vehicles in pursuit at Short Range must make a Reaction + Vehicle Skill [Handling] (2) Test to avoid crashing. The oil slick sprayer has 6 charges and can be completely refilled for 50¥.

#### **Cosmetic Modifications**

Cosmetic modifications exist in the realm between vehicle modification and vehicle equipment. They are more permanent and integrated into the vehicle itself than removable equipment, yet nowhere near as invasive as any modification. As such, they are listed as a modification but do not take up any modification slots.

*Amenities*

Sometimes it’s not enough to just get from place to place – you want to travel in comfort and style. With the amenities modification, the “living conditions” of a vehicle are upgraded to provide a more pleasant experience. A standard vehicle provides accommodations equivalent to Low Lifestyle.

*Rating 1*    0 Mod Slot**      0¥ Legal

A standard vehicle provides default amenities.

*Rating 2*    0 Mod Slots**      500¥ Legal

The vehicle is equipped with comfortable fabric seats, pleasant ergonomics and decorating and basic AR entertainment options.

*Rating 3*    0 Mod Slots**      1,000¥ Legal

The vehicle has seating made from fine materials and temperature controlled with refreshment options available. There is also a full suite of Matrix and non-electronic entertainment options to keep anyone entertained for hours.

` `*Rating 4*    0 Mod Slots**      10,000¥ Legal

Every aspect of the vehicle maximises comfort: the seats keep you warm and massage you according to a scan of your muscle tension and they are made of a non-synthetic material (possibly some kind of dead animal hide). The refreshment unit contains exotic alcohol and real food, along with access to every Matrix entertainment channel or game available.

*Enhanced Image Screens 0 Mod Slots      5,000¥ Legal*

While every vehicle in the 2070s features some degree of imaging screens to communicate important vehicle information, many riggers and vehicle owners want to enhance that image displaying capability. With enhanced image screens, every sufficiently flat surface on a vehicle (including windows) can display an electronic image or video. These images are hyper realistic and can be used to project a false image of the outside world in an attempt to deceive passengers. A Perception Test with a -4 penalty is required to notice that the images are false. Enhanced image screens can be used to display any visual feed on a PAN, perfect for team members unable to unwilling to use their AR or tie their commlink or deck into the same PAN. They can also be used for plain-old entertainment. A vehicle with enhanced image screens can display any and all Matrix AROs that they can see/access on the inside of their vehicle, making them visible to character who do not have AR equipped.

*Interior Cameras  0 Mod Slots      2,000¥ Legal*

In the course of jumping through multiple vehicles and taking in multiple streams of information from different sources, a rigger can easily lose contact with their immediate surroundings – namely, the interior of their own vehicle. As a result, many riggers install interior cameras into their vehicle so they can easily keep track of their own meat body and any passengers in the vehicle by routing the feed from the interior cameras into their PAN. Interior cameras allow a rigger to make a standard Perception Test to notice anyone or anything inside of their vehicle, even while they are in full VR mode.

*Rigger Interface  0 Mod Slots      1,000¥ Legal*

By the 2070s rigger control of vehicles have become so common that even if a rigger adaptation isn’t installed as standard for a vehicle, it can easily be added after-market. This modification allows a rigger to jump into a vehicle and control it with a full sensory experience. This includes installation of the “black box” that processes the sensory impressions for human consumption, along with a suite of sensors and relays connected to various parts of the vehicle.

*Searchlight   0 Mod Slots      800¥ Legal*

Hey, sometimes your needs are as simple as having a light to shine on things when it gets dark. The searchlight modification installs a high-powered light mounted somewhere on the exterior of the vehicle, capable of all-around movement for wherever it happens to be mounted. It can be operated remotely or manually, as long as it is physically accessible. When activated and pointed in the appropriate direction, the searchlight reduces the penalties due to darkness by one step.

### **Drones**

The skill used to pilot a microdrone varies from drone to drone.

#### **Microdrones**

*Sony Goldfish         500¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2/4|1W|1|0|0|2|2|0|

Sized to realistic proportions and capable of dives of up to four metres deep, the Goldfish is a prime example of an entry-level water drone, suitable as a trainer for youths who look toward a future as robotic operators or hobbyists who wish to explore local water holes below the surface. This drone is operated with the Pilot Watercraft skill.

*Sikorsky-Bell Microskimmer       1,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3|3P|1|0|0|3|3|0|

Quiet and durable, this disc-shaped skimmer is smaller than a frisbee and can even skim over water. It moves with small and rather weak hoverjets. It is easier to sport than the Kanmushi but still very small. It is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill; the hovercraft specialisation applies.

*Shiawase Kanmushi        1,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|2G|1|0|0|3|3|0|

This is a four-legged “bug” crawler drone that is hard to tell from a natural insect at a glance. It’s ideal for penetrating confined areas and its gecko-tipped extremities and light weight render it capable of crawling on walls and ceilings; it is, however, quite fragile and merely being stepped on swatted can easily destroy it. This drone is operated with the Pilot Walker skill.

#### **Minidrones**

*MCT Fly-Spy         2,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|3P|2|1|0|3|3|1|

This Mitsuhama drone is the size and shape of a large insect but can achieve substantially better altitudes It can serve in an “eye in the sky” role and is handy for shadowing people, given the fact that it’s relatively hard to spot. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

*Renraku Gerbil         2,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/2|2G|1|1|0|2|2|1|

A tiny, wheeled drone, the Gerbil is sized to travel through not only any ventilation shaft but most pipes, allowing it to enter a surprisingly large number of otherwise secure areas. It’s surprisingly quick and nimble, able to evade most pursuit from metahumans long enough to find a hidey-hole.

*Evo Culture Capture        3,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|1P|1|1|0|2|3|1|

A simple, single-fan vectored thrust drone, the Culture Capture is a cheaper version of the professional camera drones used by most major trideo broadcasters. The fan traded off speed for stability and whisper-quiet operation, allowing the camera to focus on the target without overwhelming the sound with the typical whirly-whoosh. Hugely popular with the would-be-influencer crowd, where it follows them everywhere and records their day, allowing them to do live updates or edit the footage later.

*Standard Upgrades: Clearsight (2) Autosoft*

*Festo Pigeon 2.0        3,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|2P|1|1|0|2|2|1|

Saeder-Krupp’s Festo subsidiary mastered the art of lifelike simulation for drone, producing the first realistic flying “bird drone” almost fifty years ago. The design has continued to be refined over the decades and now stands as a work of art. The baseline model is a chrome-plated beauty but a more lifelike model is available and is commonly used as a surveillance drone. This drone is operated with the Pilot Exotic Vehicle skill.

*Standard Upgrades: Realistic Features (1)*

*Ares Cloudship         4,000¥  Restricted Licence*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2|0R|0|1|0|2|4|1|

Solar-powered and hydrogen-filled, the Ares Cloudship is a long-duration observation drone constructed with transparent and radar-invisible materials, allowing it to hover in place for days, even weeks, rather than the hours that a conventional drone can manage. The trade-off, of course, is that the Cloudship is completely vulnerable if detected and unable to flee. While the Cloudship’s balloon is nearly as large as kitchen table when inflated, when deflated the entire unit is smaller than a bowling pin.

*Cyberspace Designs Dragonfly       4,000¥  Restricted Licence*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|2P|2|1|3|3|2|0|

Perhaps the smallest drone-hunting drone in production today, the Dragonfly is designed to follow surveillance drones anywhere they hide and bring them down. A sleek quad-copter design with in-body rotors that are protected from collisions in tight corners, the Dragonfly comes pre-equipped with a chomping “beak” of blades, allowing it to shear through the wings or body of other mini- or micro-drones, ripping them from the sky. Against larger drones, the Dragonfly can swarm, nipping away in small bites but it isn’t designed to cut through any appreciable level of armour plating. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

*Standard Upgrades: Melee Bite (Acc 3, Reach -, DV 3P, AP-2), Targeting (Melee) Autosoft*

*Aztechnology Hedgehog        8,000¥  Forbidden Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3|1G|1|1|0|4|3|0|

A specialised sub-design of the Aztechnology Crawler, the Hedgehog is the leading security-sniffing drone on the market today. Intended to find opposition command, control and communication broadcasts, it can listen is passively while running decrypting software. Parked in a hidden location, it can eavesdrop for up to 48 hours on a single charge, gather data by the gigapulse. This drone is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill.

*Standard Upgrades: Electronic Warfare (2) Autosoft*

#### **Small Drones**

*Horizon Mini-Zep        2,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2|0P|0|2|0|2|2|4|

A simple, lighter-than-air drone, the Mini-Zep is only notable due to the electrochromatic coating along the airbag’s surface. This allows the Mini-Zep to be programmed with ads for virtually anything and they can either be scrolled through or changed completely with a simple wireless signal from the home office. They also have a small radio transmitter inside, allowing them to spam AR ads to any nearby commlink. Due to being a LtA drone pushed gently with fans, they can easily loiter for eighter hours, giving maximum eyeball time to their ads. In emergency situations, they can even do live rebroadcasts of weather alerts, law enforcement APBs or anything else.

*Standard Upgrades: Electrochromatic Coating*

*Renraku Jardinero        2,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2/4|1G|1|2|0|2|2|1|

Renraku has numerous lines all based on the same chassis (which is why the Jardinero has the wrong suspension for the work it’s doing) but the Jardinero is the top-selling, so gets the nod. The basic model is simply an automated lawn mower, handling all the upkeep of suburban grass with silent electrical motors and whisper-quiet blades, when returning to a solar recharge station until told to mow again. Other versions handle vacuum duties, floor polishing, repainting parking lots and similarly menial jobs.

*Ares Ammo Drone        3,000¥  Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2|2P|2|2|4|3|2|2|

A small quadcopter drone with slots for six pistol-sized or smaller clips, four SMG or larger clips or one drum of ammo. This drone is designed to follow you and drop ammo on command so you can sustain fire in a prolonged shootout.

*Aztechnology Crawler        4,000¥  Legal*

The mechanic’s best friend. These little guys are amazing. At the core, it’s a simple dome-headed, three-wheeled drone with a single functional arm but they’re just about perfect for pitching in around the garage. They’re advanced enough to be trusted with simple work, banging out dents, changing tyres, checking the oil and so on but they are also handy assistants for harder work, presenting you with tools when you need them, keeping vehicle schematics displayed on their chest screen and keeping an eye on things when you’re beneath an undercarriage. They even have good speakers for use as a mobile stereo system. Evo hired Renraku to create a wide array of autosofts for them, giving them an option for repairing anything, handling electrical or construction work, even serving as butlers at parties.

*Standard Upgrades: Drone Arm (Strength 4, Agility 2), Automotive Mechanic Toolkit, Automotive Mechanic (2) Autosoft*

*Ferret RPD-1X Wheeled Perimeter Drone     4,000¥  Restricted Licence*

One of the oldest security drones still in production, the Ferret is a small patrol drone used as a cheap alternative to security guards. Armed with a flashlight and a taser, it’s perfectly able to handle drunk college students and would-be trespassers but shadowrunners are a different breed. That said, they see wide use in college campuses, shopping malls and many homes, serving as basic light security. It should be notes that they’re awful off-road and so they need to stay on established paths.

*Standard Upgrades: Mini Weapon Mount, Defiance Shocker, 4 Taser Darts, Flashlight*

You’ve seen these quad-copters around for years but I bet none of you knew what the actual name was. Renraku keeps the marketing for these things aimed at wholesale, not retail. The Pelican is a simple flying drone with a modular storage compartment underhung. Heated or cooled, they come in sizes for pizza, noodle boxes and more and are used by everyone from Pizza Hop to Heli-Taco to Heavenly Noodles, to make sure you get your food in thirty minutes or less anywhere in the sprawl.

Able to both slither and swim, the Sewer Snake’s long, narrow design allows it to access areas that differently shaped drones cannot and handle whatever environmental conditions it faces. The Snake’s surface is coated with several small gecko grip points, allowing it to climb vertically when pressed and it can handle the pressure of a ten-metre dive. There’s little room for further modification but in terms of eyes that can go anywhere, you’re hard-pressed to beat the Snake.

*Standard Upgrades: Submersible, Gecko Grips*

An unusual “limpet” drone stored in some Knight Errant police cruisers, the P5 is a small drone that sacrifices durability for raw speed. When at top speed, the batteries last a whopping ten minutes but that’s more than enough for this little beast. The P5 drops down from beneath the cruiser, races ahead, then magnetically attaches itself to the undercarriage of the pursued vehicle. This allows KE to follow the wireless signal instead of engaging in a high-speed chase. Simple, but effective.

*Lone Star Castle Guard        10,000¥  Restricted Licence*

“Worried about your loves ones being victims of a late night? Stay at work safely while Lone Star guards your castle!” Notice the subtle dig at their primary law enforcement rivals? Lone Star is unique in the home-security drone market in offering a pistol-armed drone, as opposed to the non-lethal options other security drones carry as standard arms. Much more common in CAS than the UCAS, the Castle Guard ads push that lethal force is the only true way to keep your family safe while you’re grinding away at your job. The Guard comes with four SmartSafety bracelets to ensure that it can’t accidentally fire at family members and additional bracelets, or pet collars, can be purchased for 50 nuyen each. The drone itself is average-sized, four-wheeled and has enough armour to turn aside small arms or baseball bats but not so much that one going wild can’t easily be stopped by heavier firepower. The marketing on these things is damned impressive, even if the actual drone is average at best.

*Standard Upgrades: Light Weapon Mount, Targeting Autosoft (3), Smartsoft, Four SmartSafety Bracelets*

With its wings folded up for transport, this VSTOL stealth craft is only the size of a cyberdeck. When it is deployed, it is the size of a large hawk or other bird of prey. Its patented signature-limiting technology makes it a favourite of intelligence agencies and shadowrunners; radar systems and visual and audio Perception Tests all receive a -3 dice pool penalty to spot the Optic-X2. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

There are a few people in this world who can’t manage cybernetics. Some are mages, some have unique nerve designs, while others believe that chrome “eats your soul” and refuse it. Some of these people can’t walk, due to either disability or infirmity. Enter the Steed, a motorised chair with wheels that can be controlled by a simple trode-based DNI. Street-legal in the city, it can also move around inside a building with ease.

The Roto-Drone is a simple, no-nonsense rotor-wing drone design that is highly modular and customisable. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

Originally more of a technological “Can we make this?” from the early days of drone research than anything, the Cheetah is the world’s fastest quad mech, matching speed with any living animal and many of today’s cars. This quad is based off the African cheetah (obviously) and trades manoeuvrability for raw speed. The claws are just for traction but the Cheetah comes with working jaws that are quite able to chomp down on metahumans if needed. Rarely, buyers replace the jaws with a taser-equipped head whose teeth are just for show.

*Standard Upgrades: Fragile (1), Jaws (Acc 3, Reach -, DV 5P, AP -3)*

*Renraku LEBD-2 Law Enforcement Backup Drone    20,000¥  Restricted Licence*

The LEBD-1 was a Ford-built police drone that never found a market with Knight Errant, Lone Star or Eagle Security. It was quietly discontinued after dismal sales. Renraku picked up the plans for virtually nothing and redesigned it somewhat for use with their Neo-PD subsidiary. The new LEBD-2 builds on the reliable roto-drone’s ability to be slotted into a charging mount on the back of a patrol car to create one-officer, one-drone teams, combining a human’s gut instincts and friendliness with a drone’s expendability and perfect recording of events. The drone can be sent to flank a home, provide fire support via the included taser and even help with paperwork. Most officers are as loyal to their drone partner as a K-9 officer to their dog and assaulting an LEBD-2 is treated as an attack on an officer in most Neo-PD subsidiaries.

*Standard Upgrades: Mini Weapon Mount, Yamaha Pulsar, 4 Taser Darts, Smartsoft, Targeting (4) Autosoft, Clearsight (4) Autosoft, Knowledge: Legal Codes (4) Autosoft*

### **Drone Modifications**

Drones can be modified using the following drone modifications.

*Drone Weapon Mounts    \* Mod Slot*

Probably the most common drone mod is finding a way to strap weapons on to one. Due to the small size of drones, standard vehicle mounts aren’t always appropriate, so drones use weapon mounts from the following chart. Each weapon mount added uses up the listed number of Mod Points (MP), allowing a drone to sometimes mount several smaller weapons rather than a single large one. All weapon mounts are at least Restricted, while some are Forbidden outside of military use. In addition, authorities are quite interested in what weapons are mounted in them! In most nations, it’s illegal for a drone to mount anything other than non-lethal weaponry.

|**Weapon Mounts**||||
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Mount**|MP|¥|Weapon|
|**Micro**|0|400|Single-shot bullet or dart|
|**Mini**|1|800|Hold-out pistol, Light pistol, small melee weapons, single-shot grenade|
|**Small**|2|1,600|Heavy Pistol, Machine Pistol|
|**Standard**|3|2,400|Sub-machine gun, under-barrel grenade launcher|
|**Large**|4|3,200|Shotgun, Hunting Rifle, Assault Rifle, Grenade Launcher|

*Option: Pop-out Drone Mounts   \* Mod Slot*

Ordinarily a weapon mount is quite obvious, as it the weapon mounted therein. Since shadowrunners tend to have quite illegal things mounted on their drones, this can be problematic, as you might imagine. There are two disguises for weapon mounts that can be used on drones. The first are blow-away panels. There are single coverings that are designed to be ejected just before the weapon is triggered. Once blown away, the weapon is left exposed and obvious, but this method is both cheap and easy. Blow-away panels may be installed with a simple Kit and cost 25¥ x the Mod Points of the weapon mount. A Perception + Intuition [Mental] (2) Test will reveal that there’s something covered, but not what it is. Once the panel is blown away, it cannot be recovered.

The other option is “pop-up” weapons (or pop-out, or pop-under as the case may be). These are weapons stored inside the body of the drone, deployed on command (requiring a Bonus Action), then retracted against with another command (also a Bonus Action). Much harder to detect (requiring a Perception (4) Test) and re-usable, the mechanisms are a bit cumbersome and complex, adding 1 to the MP consumed by a weapon thus concealed. Pop-up mounts may be installed with a Shop and they cost 100¥ x the increased MP of the weapon.

*Option: Expanded Drone Ammunition Bay  1 or 2 Mod Slots  50¥/500¥*

Unlike normal vehicular weapons, the tight constraints of a drone’s body offer limited ammunition reserves. Any weapon mounted on a drone uses the weapon’s normal ammunition limits, rather than the expanded version of a vehicle’s. There are, however, two optional ammunition bays for drones. The first is simply adding a second bin, which holds the same number of ammunition as the weapon ordinarily holds and a small switching unit to feed the weapon when one runs dry. This may be installed with a Kit, uses 1 MP and costs 50¥.

The other option is a full belt-feed system, replacing the weapon’s normal ammunition feed mechanism entirely. This requires a Shop, makes the weapon belt-fed and provides enough room for an entire belt of 100 rounds. Additional expanded ammunition bays may then be added, each holding another 100-round belt. A belt-feed system requires a Shop, uses 2 MP and costs 500¥.
