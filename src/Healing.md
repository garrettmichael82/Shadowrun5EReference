## **First Aid**

### **Action: Diagnose** (Complex)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic Mental.

The gamesmaster sets the threshold as appropriate to the character’s health or affliction and awards information appropriate to the net hits scored.

### **Action: Apply Medkit** (Complex)

Skill check: None required.

**Action: Stabilise** (Complex, Extended)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic Mental (Threshold is total damage accumulated).

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage.

Additional stabilisation tests may be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

Once a character has been stabilised, First Aid, Medicine and/or magical healing may be applied normally.

**Action: Stabilise Wound Penalties** (Complex)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic Mental

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

If successful, the wounded patient reduces their total wound modifiers by 1. The character rendering aid can choose to continue until all wound modifiers have been negated. The negation lasts for a number of hours equal to net hits of the test. At the end of that period, wound modifiers return to their normal level based on the remaining amount of damage the character has.

**Action: First Aid Treatment** (Complex *see below)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic Mental (2).

A critical glitch on a First Aid Test increases the damage by 1D3.

Anyone assisting with First Aid should roll their First Aid + Logic. For each assistant that scores at least one hit, the relevant limit for the leader’s test increases by one. Additionally, each hit the assistants make adds one die to the leader’s dice pool. The most dice that can be added to the test is equal to the leader’s rating in First Aid.

An assistant’s glitch prevents that assistant from adding an adjustment to the limit.

An assistant’s critical glitch prevents the leader from receiving any adjustment from any assistants to the limit or dice pool.

Each net hit over the threshold removes 1 box of damage (Stun or Physical).

However, divide the net effect in half (rounded up) if the person being treated is wearing any kind of full-body armour, representing the difficulty of treating a patient through armour.

The maximum damage healable with the First Aid skill is equal to the skill’s rating.

First Aid may only be applied to a character once for that set of wounds, and it may not be applied if the character has been magically healed.

Using the First Aid skill in combat requires a Complex Action and takes a number of Combat Turns equal to the number of boxes of damage the character is healing.

This means the character applying the First aid must spend one Complex Action per Combat Turn providing care but may spend the rest of their Action Phases however they would like.

## **Medicine**

**Action: Diagnose** (Complex)
Skill check: Medicine + Logic [Mental].

The gamesmaster sets the threshold as appropriate to the character’s health or affliction and awards information appropriate to the net hits scored.

**Action: Stabilise**
Skill check: Medicine + Logic [Mental] (3).

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage.

Additional stabilisation tests may be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

Once a character has been stabilised, First Aid, Medicine and/or magical healing may be applied normally.

**Action: Medical Recovery Treatment** (Extended Test)

Skill check: Medicine + Logic [Mental].

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

Each hit provides +1 die to any subsequent healing tests the character makes for healing through rest as long as the character using the Medicine skill spends some time tending to the injured character. For Physical injuries, this is typically at least 30 minutes per day tending to the injuries of the patient. For Stun it is 10 minutes per hours to gain the bonus dice.

The Medical Recovery action may only be applied once to each set of wounds, but it may be applied even if First Aid and/or magical healing have already been used. Medicine cannot be applied in combat situations.

### **Natural Recovery**

**Stun Damage: Body + Willpower** (1 hour) (Extended Test)

The character must rest for the entire hour for it to count (forced naps and unconsciousness also count).

Each hit heals 1 box of Stun damage.

**Physical Damage: Body + Body** (1 day) (Extended Test)

The character must rest for the entire day for it to count (forced naps and unconsciousness also count).

Each hit heals 1 box of Physical damage.

Physical damage cannot be healed through rest is the character also has Stun damage; the Stun damage must be healed first.

A glitch on a healing test (Stun or Physical) doubles the resting time (the damage is still healed – it just takes longer).

A critical glitch increases the damage by 1D3 boxes in addition to doubling the resting time.

### **Medical Patches**

**Administer Trauma Patch: No check** (Simple, Extended)

If placed on a dying patient, this allows them to make an immediate stabilisation test using Body + Willpower (3). If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage. Additional stabilisation tests can be made each round, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.
