# ATTRIBUTES


## **Physical Attributes**

**Body (BOD)**: Body measures your physical health and resiliency. It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poison and diseases and things of that nature.

**Agility (AGI)**: Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you’re swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.

**Reaction (REA)**: Reaction is about reflexes, awareness and your ability to respond to events happening around you. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon you act in combat and how skilled you are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail.

**Strength (STR)**: Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong you are. The higher your strength, the more damage you’ll do when you’re raining blows down on an opponent and the more you’ll be able to move or carry when there’s stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried. Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running and swimming.

## **Mental Attributes**

**Willpower (WIL)**: Willpower is your character’s desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap. Whether you’re testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.

**Logic (LOG)**: The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you to get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes. Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.

**Intuition (INT)**: Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place and stay on the trail of someone you’re pursuing.

**Charisma (CHA)**: Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It’s not entirely about your appearance, but it’s also not entirely *not* about your appearance. What it’s mostly about is how you use what you have – your voice, your face, your words and all the tools at your disposal – to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.

## **Special Attributes**

**Essence (ESS)**: Essence if your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6 and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it’s gone, it doesn’t come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance. Essence loss can also reduce healing rates.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the “uncanny valley” still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations – on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable – in one way or another, a person has become less human and on some level other people notice this.

**Edge (EDG)**: Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It’s not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect.

**Magic (MAG)**: If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. The magic attribute measures how capable you are in the arcane arts and how much power you can draw down to help you in your efforts.

**Resonance (RES)**: Resonance is the special attribute for technomancers. Technomancers interface with the Matrix using the power of their mind and Resonance measures the strength of their ability to interact and shape that environment. Non-technomancers have a zero rating for Resonance.

## **Using Edge**

Edge can affect your character’s world in a lot of ways. When you want one of these effects to happen, you must spend a point of Edge. A character can only spend Edge on their own actions; they cannot spend it on behalf of others. No more than 1 point of edge can be spent on any specific test or action at one time. You can spend a point of Edge on every roll during an Extended Test, as long as you have Edge.

**Blitz**: Roll 5D6 (plus your normal modifier) for Initiative for a single Combat Turn.

**Close Call**: Either negate the effects of one glitch or turn a critical glitch into a glitch.

**Dead Man’s Switch**: When you character is about to fall unconscious or die, you can spend a point of Edge to make a Body + Willpower (3) test. If you succeed, you may take a single action before your character blacks out.

**Push the Limit**: Gain a +3 dice pool modifier to your test, either before or after the roll. The Rule of Six applies: for every 6 you roll, count it as a success and then re-roll that die, adding any additional hits from the re-roll to your total. If you decide to use this after rolling, only your Edge dice use the Rule of Six. This use of Edge also allows you to ignore any limit on your test.

**Second Chance**: Re-roll all dice that did not score a hit on a test roll. It cannot be used to negate a glitch or a critical glitch. It does not use the Rule of Six and has no effect on limits.

**Seize the Initiative**: Move to the top of the initiative order, regardless of your Initiative Score for the entire Combat turn.

### **Regaining Edge**

Your character gets one point of Edge back after a fulfilling meal and a good night’s sleep. Additionally, the gamesmaster may reward players with a refreshed point of Edge for situations such as: good roleplaying, heroic acts of self-sacrifice, achievement of important personal goals, succeeding in an important objective, being particularly brave or smart, pushing the storyline forward, impressing the group with humour or drama.

## **Attribute Limits**

- Characters have **three inherent limits** – Physical, Mental and Social – that are derived from their attributes.
- You only use successes on a roll to the maximum of your limit.
- You can ignore your limit for a single test by spending a point of Edge.

**Physical Limit:** [(Strength x2) + Body + Reaction] /3 (round up)

**Mental Limit:** [(Logic x2) + Intuition + Willpower] /3 (round up)

**Social Limit:** [(Charisma x2)] + Willpower + Essence] /3 (round up)

## **Attribute-Only Tests**

While most tests are rolled based on a relevant attribute and skill combined, these tests are based on attributes only:

**Composure (CHA + WIL)**: Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened professionals like shadowrunners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a Willpower + Charisma Test, with a threshold based on the severity of the situation. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed gangers will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**Judge Intentions (CHA + INT)**: Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed Intuition + Charisma Test against the target’s Willpower + Charisma. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change) and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**Lifting/Carrying (BOD + STR)**:

|**Lift/Carry Type**|**Baseline**|**Strength + Body Test increases max weight by:**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Lifting off the ground**|15kg per point of Strength|15kg per hit|
|**Lifting over head, i.e. clean & jerk**|5kg per point of Strength|5 kg per hit|
|**Carrying capacity**|10kg per point of Strength*(in gear, without effort)*|10kg per hit|

If a character overburdens themselves with gear, they suffer encumbrance modifiers. For every 15 kilograms (or part thereof) by which you exceed your carrying capacity, you suffer a -1 modifier to your Physical Limit (minimum limit of 1). This means that a character with Strength 3 (Carrying Capacity 30) that is trudging along with 50 kilograms of equipment suffers a -2 penalty to their Physical Limit.

**Memory (LOG + WIL)**: While there are numerous mnemonic devices and even a few select pieces of bioware, designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information, make a Logic + Willpower Test at the time of memorisation. Each hit adds a die to the Recall Test later on.

>Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the >character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order >of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has >completely fooled themselves into believing and thus remembering >something that never actually happened.

## **Initiative**

Initiative governs how quickly a character responds in a combat situation.

**Physical Initiative**: (Intuition + Reaction) + 1D6

**Astral Initiative**: (Intuition x2) + 3D6

**Matrix AR Initiative**: (Intuition + Reaction) + 1D6

**Matrix VR Initiative (Cold Sim)**: (Response + Intuition) + 3D6

**Matrix VR Initiative (Hot Sim)**: (Response + Intuition) + 4D6

**Matrix VR Initiative (Technomancer)**: (Resonance + Intuition) + 4D6

## **Condition Monitor Boxes**

Condition Monitors are used to track the damage inflicted on a character. Player characters have two Condition Monitors: one tracks Physical damage, the other tracks Stun damage.

**Physical**: (Body/2) + 8 (round up)

**Stun**: (Willpower/2) + 8 (round up)

**Overflow**: Body

## **Reputation**

When you live on the street, with no identity in the system, your rep is all that you’ve got. To shadowrunners and others who exist between the cracks of society, how they are known (and who knows them) is the only piece of information that stays with them and carries any significance. A good reputation gives a person respect and influence among their peers, allowing them to more easily acquire equipment and favours. Conversely, a bad rep can make dealing with anyone in the shadows more difficult.

**Street Cred**: **Starts at 0.**

Street Cred represents a character’s lifetime accomplishments. The more they’ve done and accomplished, the more respected they’ll be by their peers.

Street Cred is applied as a positive Limit Modifier to all Social Tests in situations where the character’s reputation would be known. It is gained by completing shadowruns.

**Notoriety**: **Starts at 0**, modified by various qualities (Positive: Blandness, First Impression, Lucky; Negative: Addiction, Bad Luck, Combat Paralysis, Elf Poser, Gremlins, Incompetent [any skill], Ork Poser, SINner [criminal SIN only], Spirit Bane, Uncouth, Uneducated)

Notoriety represents the negative side of the character’s reputation. If they are difficult to work with, stubborn, unskilled fatally flawed or prone to failure, word is going to get around about them.

**Public Awareness**: **Starts at 0.**

Public Awareness represents how well the character is known among the media, authorities and public at large. With only a few exceptions, shadowrunners are always working to ensure that the public doesn’t know anything about who they are or what they have done. Corporations and other power groups hire runners when they want something taken care of quietly without a great deal of public attention drawn to it. So, if a runner is doing their job, the public should never know about them. The best shadowrunner is one that Joe Wageslave has never heard of. Only when something goes wrong or the situation is unavoidable do the actions of a runner become public.
