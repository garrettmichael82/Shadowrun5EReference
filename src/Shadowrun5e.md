<a name="_toc218024785"></a>**HOW TO SHADOWRUN** \

=================================================

Diving into a new RPG system can be daunting, so here’s a recommended approach to getting to know this edition of Shadowrun in a manageable way: 
### **STEP 1 – Get to know the universe (a little)** 
Obtain a rough idea of the Shadowrun universe, i.e. the setting of this RPG. The lore of this universe is *very, very* detailed – don’t feel like you need to know everything. Knowing “a little about a lot” will go a long way here. Here are some starter concepts to learn *a little* about: 

- - History in the Shadowrun universe was the same as IRL up to what year? 
- - What is Goblinification? 
- - What role does magic play in this universe? 
- - What is The Matrix? 
- - What are Megacorporations?  
- - What are Shadowrunners and what role do they play? 

**Recommended resources for your research:** 

- - [“Shadowrun Lore” YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJx6lCH0Rg&list=PLl1ffEF0w9j0-zsDASBLtF_E7nEeJUeRt)
- - [“Edge of Now” PDF](https://1drv.ms/b/c/a73fd13bc13e0f03/IQDCsBG4gE_CR7bcaJ9YHKCCAXTHSTin8wGzGBoOU3JD9QI?e=MuyZF7) 
### **STEP 2 – Get to know the game play mechanics (a little)** 
Read through the “BASIC GAMEPLAY MECHANICS” section of this rulebook. This will help you understand the actual in-game impact of the various decisions to be made during character creation. 
### **STEP 3 – Get to know the various character elements (a little)**  
It’s important not to *commit* to any character ideas yet. First, gain a basic understanding of Shadowrun character creation by skimming through a few key sections of this rulebook, listed below. As you skim, you might like to consider the broad type/s of character/s you might enjoy playing, but don’t set anything in stone. 

- - Metatypes 
- - Attributes
- - Skills
- - Magic & Technomancy Traits 
- - Decking/Rigging (see “The Matrix” section) 
- - Cyberware and Bioware 
### **STEP 4 – Consult the party** 
At this stage, it pays to consult with your fellow players. Discuss the characters you’re each interested in playing and see if you can agree upon a variety of different roles/skills, avoiding too much overlap and covering a range of abilities. 

**Consider party roles/skills like:** 

- - The “face” 
- - Stealth
- - Ranged damage 
- - Melee damage 
- - Non-lethal takedowns
- - Breaking and entering
- - Disabling security systems 
- - Hacking
- - Healing
- - Countering magical threats
- - Investigation 
- - Driving / piloting 
- - Drone control 
- - Underworld knowledge
### **STEP 5 – Character creation**
Once you’ve got a more solid idea for a character that a.) you’d like to play and b.) will work within your party, you can start creating your character.

**Before** diving into the full “crunch” of the character sheet and worrying about how point buy works etc., consider the following questions in this order first. Copy/paste this table to take rough notes as you go.  

|**1**|Do you want your character to be **magical, a technomancer, or neither?**||
| :-: | :- | :- |
|**2**|Which **Skills** do you want your character to have?|<p>Definitely want these: </p><p></p><p>Would like these: </p><p></p><p>These would be a cool/fun bonus: </p><p></p>|
|**3**|Which **Attributes** will best support these skills?|<p>Definitely: </p><p></p><p>Some points in these would also be good:</p><p></p>|
|**4**|Are there any particular **Metatype/s (or Metavariant/s)** that have strengths or bonuses in those Attribute/s?||

Now you’re ready (well, as you’ll ever be!) to dive into the crunch. Open up your character sheet and complete it by starting with the “Character Creation” section of this rulebook and working your way forward from there. Breaking this up into more than one session is a good idea. Once you reach the end of “Equipment”, including “Vehicles”, you’re done! 
### **STEP 6 – Check you’ve covered everything**   
Use the checklist below to ensure your character isn’t missing any crucial elements: 

☐ Metatype selected

☐ Magic, Resonance or Mundane chosen

☐ Attributes include modifications for bioware/cyberware

☐ Skills selected

☐ Knowledges and Languages selected

☐ Qualities selected

☐ Contacts selected

☐ Lifestyle selected

☐ Equipment selected

☐ Nuyen remaining is under 5,000

☐ PAN created


☐ Do you have a Commlink, Cyberdeck or RCC?

☐ Do you have a way to carry or store your gear?

☐ Do you have a SIN?

☐ Do you way of travelling from A to B (car, motorcycle, bus pass)?

☐ Can you deal damage in melee and at range?

☐ Can you be stealthy enough to avoid waking a sleeping guard?

☐ Do you have a silent or quiet way of dealing damage?

☐ Can you move about the city without people calling the police after looking at you?


**BASIC GAMEPLAY MECHANICS**\

============================
### **Hits & Thresholds**
- *Shadowrun* uses **6-sided dice.**
- The number of dice rolled for any test is determined by the character’s relevant skill – the better they are at what they’re attempting to do, the more dice the player will roll.
- For each die rolled, a result of a **5 or 6 is a “hit”**.
- All tests are rolled against a **threshold** – the number of hits required to succeed, which is proportional to the difficulty of the test. The number of hits must either meet or beat the threshold** to succeed. An easy test may require 1 hit (i.e. a threshold of 1), the average is 2 and a hard test may require 4.
- Any number of hits rolled in excess of the threshold is referred to as your **net hits**. These can have positive effects such as increasing the damage you do in combat or the speed with which a task is accomplished.
### **Glitches**
- If more than half the dice rolled show a 1, this is a **glitch** – something bad happens. 
- It is possible to roll a glitch on a test that has enough hits to be successful. The glitch does **not** cancel the success; instead, the glitch occurs in addition to the success.
- If you roll a glitch and also do not achieve a single hit, this is a **critical glitch** – something extremely bad happens.
- *Note*: The *Close Call* use of Edge (see below) can be used to negate a glitch or reduce a critical glitch to a glitch.
### **Limits**
- A **limit** indicates the maximum hits from your initial roll that can be applied to the test. 
- Limits are determined by your attributes (see below) or your equipment (see below).
- *Note*: The *Push the Limit* use of Edge (see below) can be used to remove the limit from a test.
### **Teamwork Tests**
- Choose a leader for the teamwork test. All others serve as assistants.
- Each assistant rolls the appropriate skill + attribute. For each assistant that scores at least one hit, the limit for the leader’s test increases by one.
- Additionally, each hit the assistants make adds one die to the leader’s dice pool.
- The most dice that can be added to the test is equal to the leader’s rating in the applicable skill or the highest attribute rating if the test involves two attributes.
- If any assistant rolls a critical glitch, then the leader receives no bonus to their relevant limit or additional dice from any of the assistants.
- The leader then rolls their adjusted dice pool and tries to beat the threshold for the test.



**<a name="_toc218024787"></a>CHARACTER CREATION**\

==================================================
### **Point Buy**
The Point Buy method has greater flexibility than any other system; the trade-off, of course, is that the complete range of options available can make character creation a somewhat time-consuming process. For many though, the time investment is worth it, as you have the chance to design a character precisely the way you want it to be.

- In the Point Buy system, you **start with 800 Karma** to spend.
- First, select a Metatype, followed by Magic or Resonance type if desired. 
- Then spend Karma to buy attributes, skills, qualities and nuyen. 
- Nuyen is then spent on lifestyle and gear with a maximum of 5,000¥ remaining at the start of the game.
- Language and knowledge skills, and contacts, are purchased with their own points systems, determined by relevant attributes.


**<a name="_toc218024788"></a>METATYPES**\

=========================================
### **Human** 
**Human *(Homo sapiens sapiens)*** is the metatype that has been around the longest. You know them, you love them and if you’re reading this there’s a high probability that you are one. They are balanced in their abilities and tend to have a little larger portion of luck (represented by Edge) than other metatypes. **(Cost = 0 Karma)**
### **Dwarf**
**Dwarfs *(Homo sapiens pumilionis)***, as you may guess, are shorter and stockier than humans. They tend to be quite strong and very resilient, able to recover from damage ranging from knocks to the head to doses of hemlock. Or knocks to the head with a club wrapped in hemlock leaves. Dwarves are hard workers and tend to be highly valued by corporations, which means they are more deeply integrated into human society than the other metatypes. They still face discrimination due to their size and they often have to take steps to make a world built for humans suitable for them. **(Cost = 50 Karma)**
#### **Metavariant subspecies: Gnome**
The gnome variant of the ***Homo sapiens pumilionis***, subspecies maintains the standard thermographic vision, slightly pointed aural helix and extended lifespan of the primary subspecies. Where the subspecies varies physically is in body hair, lessened height and musculature. The gnome metavariant lacks the distinctive body hair of their primary species; in fact, they lack all body hair except for head hair which is usually dark brown or black. Though standard dwarves are short of stature, gnomes are smaller still, with heights rarely exceeding 1.0 metre, averaging only 85 centimetres. Body masses average under 30 kilograms due to the metatype’s dense musculature. This dense muscle on a smaller frame allows gnomes a strength greater than one would expect, though still less than a standard human. **(Cost = 50 Karma)**
### **Elf**
**Elves *(Homo sapiens nobilis)*** are taller than humans, thinner and have pointed ears. They have an extremely annoying knack for being more nimble than humans and they generally are better looking to boot. They also have very long lifespans and continue to look young into their forties and fifties. They have occasionally been known to lord those facts over humans or anyone who comes within hearing range. **(Cost = 40 Karma)**
#### **Metavariant subspecies: Forest Elf**
The forest elf metavariant possesses the same primary physical characteristics of the *nobilis* metatype, with a slight decrease in their average height. The only extensive variation is in their skin. Their epidermal layer integrates sections of cells containing chloroplasts as well as body hair similar to grass. These organelles employ chlorophyll to produce energy through plant-like photosynthesis. **Cost = (50 Karma)**
### **Ork**
**Orks *(Homo sapiens robustus)*** look like the creatures that have been dying by the score in fantasy movies and trideos for almost one hundred and fifty years. With protruding brows, prominent tusks and a large stature, orks have trouble avoiding the stereotype of being unthinkingly violent brutes. It doesn’t help that there are more than a few orks who are happy to live up to that stereotype rather than fight it. The end result is a certain underlying tension between orks and humans, which leads to both groups often preferring to live in separate communities. Elves and orks, on the other hand, often prefer to live in entirely separate countries. Despite the stereotypes, orks can be found in all walks of life, from dank alleys to corporate boardrooms. They have a shorter lifespan than humans, which often leads to them having a certain desperation to pack as much living into their years as they can. **(Cost = 50 Karma)**
#### **Metavariant subspecies: Ogre**
The **Ogre** metavariant possesses the standard low-light vison, muscular bulk, enlarged lower canines and pointed aural helix of their primary subspecies. The variation on standard *homo sapiens robustus* come in smoother skin, a protruding jaw, a wider mouth and a stomach similar to the tin-can-eating goats of urban legend. The ogre metavariant stands at a height similar to standard homo sapiens, though the muscular robustness of the species is still present. Ogres seem even closer to their progenitors due to the smoothness of their skin, a trait often lacking in the standard *robustus*, whose skin is often thick and rough. The jawline and wider mouth of the ogre originally spawned urban legends of cannibalism; these rumours were proven false by the ‘40s, but those raised during the era of its prevalence still feel the effects of this misconception. This urban legend was aided by the fact that ogres can digest almost anything they can swallow. The ability to digest so much leads to obesity and even the most athletic ogres can still have a healthy paunch. **(Cost = 60 Karma)**
### **Troll**
**Trolls *(Homo sapiens ingentis)*** make orks look like the ordinary man on the street. Orks might be, on average, less than a quarter-meter taller than humans; troll, by contrast are more than a half-meter taller than orks. Orks might look like a monstrous version of humanity; trolls, on the other hand, look like vaguely human versions of the creature from your most recent nightmare. With thick, curled horns on their heads (some trolls prefer to have them cut, while others polish them with pride), spiky protrusions of calcium on their joints and individual muscles that are larger than a full-grown pig, trolls give the immediate impression that they are built for destruction. Most of them are able to live up to that image. Not all trolls, though, are about absorbing and inflicting damage. They have tried to find their way into different roles, but their large size combines with cultural stereotypes to make it hard for them to fit it. Orks tend to be the most accepting of trolls and the two metatypes often inhabit the same neighbourhoods. Typically, these are not the most resource-rich neighbourhoods in any given sprawl. **(Cost = 80 Karma)**
#### **Metavariant subspecies: Minotaur**
**Minotaurs** possess the enhanced muscle mass and thermographic vision of the primary *ingentis* subspecies. Variance occurs in their facial and horn structures, height, body hair and dermal deposit formation. Minotaurs get their name from their wide, flattened nasal structure, wide-set eyes and symmetrical horns, which resemble a bull’s face. Minotaur horns are longer than those of trolls, set at a more forward angle and anchored into thick bone plates that allow the horns to withstand greater impact. They are also nearly four times denser than standard *ingentis* horns. These features allow minotaurs to use their horns in more aggressive ways. Minotaurs also average 10 centimetres shorter than trolls but tend to carry the same bulk with added width, further lending to their bullish appearance. This *ingentis* metavariant usually possesses profuse body hair and a distinct lack of the dermal deposits common to the base subspecies. **(Cost = 90 Karma)**
### **Metatype Attributes**

||**Karma Cost**|**Bonus Racial Attributes**|**Maximum Racial Attributes**|**Racial Bonuses**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Human**|0|+1 Edg|Edge 7|None|
|**Dwarf**|50|+2 Bod, +2 Str, +1 Wil|Bod 8, Rea 5, Str 8, Wil 7|Thermographic Vision, +2 dice Pathogen & Toxin Resistance, +20% increased Lifestyle cost|

|**Minotaur**|90|+5 Bod, +4 Str|Bod 11, Agi 5, Str 10, Log 5, Cha 4|Thermographic Vision, Goring Horns, +1 Reach, +100% Lifestyle cost|
### **Racial Bonuses**
**Arcane Arrester (2)**: When targeted by a spell (including a critter’s Innate Spell), the character is harder to affect. This potent ability makes casting both benevolent and malevolent spells on these characters much more difficult. The character adds 4 dice to their resistance test against any spell. If the spell is one that is not normally resisted (such as invisibility), the character still rolls their Arcane Arrester dice pool and reduces the hits rolled on the Spellcasting Test by any hits they roll. This quality affects spells they cast on themselves.

**Dermal Armour +1**: You gain a +1 Armour bonus (cumulative with other Armour, without adding Encumbrance).

**Goring Horns**: Use Exotic Melee Weapon (Horns) skill. DV (STR+2)P, Reach-, AP -1.

**Low-Light Vision**: You can see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness though.

**Neoteny**: Halted physical development that leaves them easily mistaken for children or teenagers. Starting Physical Condition Monitor is reduced by 2.

**Pathogen and Toxin Resistance**: Add a +2 dice pool bonus to resist pathogens and toxins.

**Photometabolism**: Forest elves possess some chloroplast skin and grasslike body hair, that supplements their energy needs via photosynthesis. Even when fully exposed to sunlight, this process only creates enough nourishment to supplement a diet, not to replace it. Reduce their Lifestyle costs by ten percent. However, since the character’s overall physical well-being and energy increase in the sunlight, the character feels uncomfortable at night or in the shade, suffering a -1 dice pool penalty on all Social Tests.

**Reach +1**: You have longer reach, giving you an advantage over enemies with lower reach.

**Thermographic Vision**: You can see into the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately and so on.
### **Height and Weight**
Choose the height and weight of your character. The table beneath is a guideline to give you an idea of averages for various metatypes. To get a proportional weight, determine the new height as a percentage of the average height, convert that to a decimal number, cube that figure and then multiply it by the average weight.

|**Metatype**|**Sex**|**Av. Height**|**Av. Weight**|**Weight Multiplier**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Human**|Female|156 cm|54\.5 kg|1\.00|
||Male|170 cm|70\.0 kg|1\.00|
|**Dwarf**|Female|120 cm|44\.3 kg|1\.8|
||Male|120 cm|44\.3 kg|1\.8|
|**Elf**|Female|175 cm|60\.9 kg|0\.80|
||Male|190 cm|78\.2 kg|0\.80|
|**Ork**|Female|182 cm|110\.0 kg|1\.28|
||Male|190 cm|125\.1 kg|1\.28|
|**Troll**|Female|280 cm|491\.1 kg|1\.57|
||Male|280 cm|491\.1 kg|1\.57|
|**Gnome**|Female|110 cm|22\.8 kg|1\.2|
||Male|110 cm|22\.8 kg|1\.2|
|**Forest Elf**|Female|175 cm|60\.9 kg|0\.80|
||Male|190 cm|78\.2 kg|0\.80|
|**Ogre**|Female|163 cm|104\.9 kg|1\.7|
||Male|170 cm|119\.0 kg|1\.7|
|**Minotaur**|Female|230 cm|277\.4 kg|1\.6|
||Male|230 cm|277\.4 kg|1\.6|


**<a name="_toc218024789"></a>ATTRIBUTES**\

==========================================
### **Minimums and Maximums**
- All characters **start with a score of 1** in all attributes.
- Then add any relevant Bonus Racial Attributes listed in the Metatype Attributes table above. 
- At character creation, the natural **maximum for attribute scores 6** unless otherwise specified in the Metatype Attributes table above. Further, at creation, characters may only have **1 Mental or Physical** attribute at this maximum (this excludes Edge, Magic and Resonance).
### **Physical Attributes**
**Body (BOD)**: Body measures your physical health and resiliency. It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poison and diseases and things of that nature.

**Agility (AGI)**: Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you’re swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.

**Reaction (REA)**: Reaction is about reflexes, awareness and your ability to respond to events happening around you. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon you act in combat and how skilled you are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail.

**Strength (STR)**: Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong you are. The higher your strength, the more damage you’ll do when you’re raining blows down on an opponent and the more you’ll be able to move or carry when there’s stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried. Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running and swimming.
### **Mental Attributes**
**Willpower (WIL)**: Willpower is your character’s desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap. Whether you’re testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.

**Logic (LOG)**: The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you to get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes. Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.

**Intuition (INT)**: Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place and stay on the trail of someone you’re pursuing.

**Charisma (CHA)**: Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It’s not entirely about your appearance, but it’s also not entirely *not* about your appearance. What it’s mostly about is how you use what you have – your voice, your face, your words and all the tools at your disposal – to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.
### **Special Attributes**
**Essence (ESS)**: Essence if your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6 and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it’s gone, it doesn’t come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance. Essence loss can also reduce healing rates.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the “uncanny valley” still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations – on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable – in one way or another, a person has become less human and on some level other people notice this.

**Edge (EDG)**: Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It’s not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect.

**Magic (MAG)**: If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. The magic attribute measures how capable you are in the arcane arts and how much power you can draw down to help you in your efforts.

**Resonance (RES)**: Resonance is the special attribute for technomancers. Technomancers interface with the Matrix using the power of their mind and Resonance measures the strength of their ability to interact and shape that environment. Non-technomancers have a zero rating for Resonance.
### **Using Edge**
Edge can affect your character’s world in a lot of ways. When you want one of these effects to happen, you must spend a point of Edge. A character can only spend Edge on their own actions; they cannot spend it on behalf of others. No more than 1 point of edge can be spent on any specific test or action at one time. You can spend a point of Edge on every roll during an Extended Test, as long as you have Edge.

**Blitz**: Roll 5D6 (plus your normal modifier) for Initiative for a single Combat Turn.

**Close Call**: Either negate the effects of one glitch or turn a critical glitch into a glitch.

**Dead Man’s Switch**: When you character is about to fall unconscious or die, you can spend a point of Edge to make a Body + Willpower (3) test. If you succeed, you may take a single action before your character blacks out.

**Push the Limit**: Gain a +3 dice pool modifier to your test, either before or after the roll. The Rule of Six applies: for every 6 you roll, count it as a success and then re-roll that die, adding any additional hits from the re-roll to your total. If you decide to use this after rolling, only your Edge dice use the Rule of Six. This use of Edge also allows you to ignore any limit on your test.

**Second Chance**: Re-roll all dice that did not score a hit on a test roll. It cannot be used to negate a glitch or a critical glitch. It does not use the Rule of Six and has no effect on limits.

**Seize the Initiative**: Move to the top of the initiative order, regardless of your Initiative Score for the entire Combat turn.
### **Regaining Edge**
Your character gets one point of Edge back after a fulfilling meal and a good night’s sleep. Additionally, the gamesmaster may reward players with a refreshed point of Edge for situations such as: good roleplaying, heroic acts of self-sacrifice, achievement of important personal goals, succeeding in an important objective, being particularly brave or smart, pushing the storyline forward, impressing the group with humour or drama.
### **Attribute Limits**
- Characters have **three inherent limits** – Physical, Mental and Social – that are derived from their attributes. 
- You only use successes on a roll to the maximum of your limit.
- You can ignore your limit for a single test by spending a point of Edge.

**Physical Limit:** [(Strength x2) + Body + Reaction] /3 (round up)

**Mental Limit:** [(Logic x2) + Intuition + Willpower] /3 (round up)

**Social Limit:** [(Charisma x2)] + Willpower + Essence] /3 (round up)
### **Attribute Karma Cost**
Rating 1 ® 2 (10 Karma)		Rating 2 ® 3 (15 Karma)		Rating 3 ® 4 (20 Karma)

Rating 4 ® 5 (25 Karma)		Rating 5 ® 6 (30 Karma)		Rating 6 ® 7 (35 Karma)

Rating 7 ® 8 (40 Karma)		Rating 8 ® 9 (45 Karma)		Rating 9 ® 10 (50 Karma)

***Note*:** When increasing attributes, ensure racial modifiers are applied **first**, **then** spend points to increase attributes further.
### **Attribute-Only Tests**
While most tests are rolled based on a relevant attribute and skill combined, these tests are based on attributes only:

**Composure (CHA + WIL)**: Some situations are tough to deal with, even for hardened professionals like shadowrunners. When a character is faced with an emotionally overwhelming situation there are only two choices. Stay and fight or turn into a quivering lump of goo. To find out which one happens, make a Willpower + Charisma Test, with a threshold based on the severity of the situation. Take note that repeating similar situations over and again eventually eliminates the need to perform this test. Staring down a group of well-armed gangers will be scary at first, but after a character does it a few times the fear gives way to instinct.

**Judge Intentions (CHA + INT)**: Reading another person is also a matter of instinct. A character can use their instincts to guess at the intentions of another person or to gauge how much they can trust someone. Make an Opposed Intuition + Charisma Test against the target’s Willpower + Charisma. This is not an exact science. A successful test doesn’t mean the target will never betray you (intentions have been known to change) and deceptive characters can gain another’s confidence easily. This primarily serves as a benchmark or gut instinct about how much you can trust the person you are dealing with.

**Lifting/Carrying (BOD + STR)**: 

|**Lift/Carry Type**|**Baseline**|**Strength + Body Test <br>increases max weight by:**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Lifting off the ground**|15kg per point of Strength|15kg per hit|
|**Lifting over head, i.e. clean & jerk**|5kg per point of Strength|5 kg per hit|
|**Carrying capacity**|<p>10kg per point of Strength</p><p>*(in gear, without effort)*</p>|10kg per hit|

If a character overburdens themselves with gear, they suffer encumbrance modifiers. For every 15 kilograms (or part thereof) by which you exceed your carrying capacity, you suffer a -1 modifier to your Physical Limit (minimum limit of 1). This means that a character with Strength 3 (Carrying Capacity 30) that is trudging along with 50 kilograms of equipment suffers a -2 penalty to their Physical Limit.

**Memory (LOG + WIL)**: While there are numerous mnemonic devices and even a few select pieces of bioware, designed for remembering information, memory is not a skill. If a character needs to recall information, make a Logic + Willpower Test at the time of memorisation. Each hit adds a die to the Recall Test later on.

Glitches can have a devastating effect on memory. A glitch means the character misremembers some portion of the information, such as order of numbers in a passcode. A critical glitch means the character has completely fooled themselves into believing and thus remembering something that never actually happened.
### **Initiative**
Initiative governs how quickly a character responds in a combat situation.

**Physical Initiative**: (Intuition + Reaction) + 1D6

**Astral Initiative**: (Intuition x2) + 3D6

**Matrix AR Initiative**: (Intuition + Reaction) + 1D6

**Matrix VR Initiative (Cold Sim)**: (Response + Intuition) + 3D6

**Matrix VR Initiative (Hot Sim)**: (Response + Intuition) + 4D6

**Matrix VR Initiative (Technomancer)**: (Resonance + Intuition) + 4D6
### **Condition Monitor Boxes**
Condition Monitors are used to track the damage inflicted on a character. Player characters have two Condition Monitors: one tracks Physical damage, the other tracks Stun damage.

**Physical**: (Body/2) + 8 (round up)

**Stun**: (Willpower/2) + 8 (round up)

**Overflow**: Body
### **Reputation**
When you live on the street, with no identity in the system, your rep is all that you’ve got. To shadowrunners and others who exist between the cracks of society, how they are known (and who knows them) is the only piece of information that stays with them and carries any significance. A good reputation gives a person respect and influence among their peers, allowing them to more easily acquire equipment and favours. Conversely, a bad rep can make dealing with anyone in the shadows more difficult.

**Street Cred**: **Starts at 0.**

Street Cred represents a character’s lifetime accomplishments. The more they’ve done and accomplished, the more respected they’ll be by their peers.

Street Cred is applied as a positive Limit Modifier to all Social Tests in situations where the character’s reputation would be known. It is gained by completing shadowruns.

**Notoriety**: **Starts at 0**, modified by various qualities (Positive: Blandness, First Impression, Lucky; Negative: Addiction, Bad Luck, Combat Paralysis, Elf Poser, Gremlins, Incompetent [any skill], Ork Poser, SINner [criminal SIN only], Spirit Bane, Uncouth, Uneducated)

Notoriety represents the negative side of the character’s reputation. If they are difficult to work with, stubborn, unskilled fatally flawed or prone to failure, word is going to get around about them.

**Public Awareness**: **Starts at 0.**

Public Awareness represents how well the character is known among the media, authorities and public at large. With only a few exceptions, shadowrunners are always working to ensure that the public doesn’t know anything about who they are or what they have done. Corporations and other power groups hire runners when they want something taken care of quietly without a great deal of public attention drawn to it. So, if a runner is doing their job, the public should never know about them. The best shadowrunner is one that Joe Wageslave has never heard of. Only when something goes wrong or the situation is unavoidable do the actions of a runner become public.


**<a name="_toc218024790"></a>MAGIC AND TECHNOMANCY TRAITS**\

============================================================
### **Magic-Users**
#### **Adept: (20 Karma)** 
In the small segment of the world that has Awakened to magic power, there is an even smaller segment who are able to channel the mana into themselves, giving them enhanced physical abilities that make them more than meta-human. They are the physical adepts – or, for those who like fewer words, just adepts – and they are known for their very disciplined self-improvement. They include athletes, martial artists, religious acolyte, exercise gurus and others who seek to combine mind and body. Adepts are concerned with the harmony of body and mind and the strengthening of both and they focus their magical power towards those ends.

In the early days of the Sixth World, when the world saw the rise of people who could use magic to increase their own physical and mental potential, adepts didn’t face the same prejudice as magicians and shamans. Instead, they found themselves facing a mythos generated by corporate trids extolling their magical athleticism. This put adepts up on a pedestal – people either wanted to try to fight them to gain rep or to worship them, thinking that perhaps that would be the path to getting some abilities for themselves.

They have a Magic attribute of 1 and can buy more ranks with Karma.

They gain power points equal to their Magic attribute at character creation. You then spend the Power Points on buying adept powers. The maximum number of levels you can have of any one power is equal to your Magic Rating or up to the limit listed by the power, whichever is less.

Adepts cannot learn skills from the Conjuring, Enchanting or Sorcery skill groups.

Adepts can only astrally perceive if they take the Astral Perception power. Adepts can learn the Assensing skill only if they have the Astral Perception power.

Adepts cannot astrally project.
#### **Aware: (10 Karma)** 
The Aware have **astral perception** as their lone magical ability, a truly minor ability that nonetheless sets them higher than the truly mundane. The aware have been known for ages as readers of auras, palms or other forms of psychometry but simply being able to see magical activity is power enough to serve them as researchers, observing the magic used by others and taking note. The largest place for them, by far, is in the world of security, serving in personal security details to ensure no magic is used to influence negotiations, to keep an eye out for spiritual intrusion or to direct security details against enchanted intruders. Several have found a place as musicians as well, as being able to read the emotional state of a crowd and adjusting their performance to it is a significant asset.

They have a Magic attribute of 1 and can buy more ranks with Karma.

**<a name="_toc218024791"></a>SKILLS**\

======================================
### **Skill Karma Cost**

|**Rating:**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**6**|**7**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Skill Group|5|15|30|50|75|105|140|
|Skill|2|6|12|20|30|42|56|
|Knowledge Skill\*|1|3|6|10|15|21|28|
|Language Skill\*|1|3|6|10|15|21|28|

*\*Knowledge and Language Skills are first purchased based on their own points system – see “Knowledge and Language Skills” below. The above Karma points can be spent to purchase additional Knowledge Skills and/or Languages, if desired.*
### **What the Ratings Mean**
**Rating 0 - Untrained**: The default level of knowledge. Though untrained, you have a general awareness of the skill and occasionally may even be able to fake it.

**Rating 1 - Beginner**: You have a little training about how it works, but not always why it works.

**Rating 2 - Novice**: You’re a hobbyist, but not an enthusiast.

**Rating 3 - Competent**: You’re skilled at basic operations but struggle with complex operations and “tricks”.

**Rating 4 - Proficient**: You’re comfortable with what you do and perform well under normal pressures. Professional level for most jobs.

**Rating 5 - Skilled**: You know how to handle yourself in unfamiliar situations and can get creative when solving problems.

**Rating 6 - Professional**: You could easily sell your skills on the open market. This is the usual **maximum skill level for starting player characters.**

**Rating 7 - Veteran**: You’ve seen a lot of what the skill can do and what it can’t. Other people ask you how to do it.
### **Skill Groups**
Skill Groups are a collection of skills based around a core concept. You can purchase a skill group for less than it costs to take all the skills in the group individually. Having a skill group at a certain rating is the same as having all the skills in the skill group at that rating.

Skill group advancement uses special rules. If you want to advance one skill from the group without advancing the rest, the skill group is broken and you get each of the skills in the group at the former group rating; then you can increase one of the skills. If you want to get the skill group back (or get a new one), you must first get all the skills in the group to the same rating.

### **Specialisations**
If you devote extra time to a subset of a skill, it’s called a specialisation. A specialisation adds a +2 dice pool modifier to any test made for that skill when the specialisation comes into play. Characters can have multiple specialisations within the same skill, but only one applies at a time. New characters may only take one specialisation per skill at character creation, but you can buy more later. If you want a specialisation in a skill, you need a rating of at least 1 in that skill. Specialisations are not allowed for skill groups. A specialisation costs 7 karma.
### **Defaulting**
It is impossible to prepare for every scenario and only slightly harder to have every skill. When you perform an action without actually having the skill for the test, there’s still hope. You can **default** the skill, making the test using only the attribute to form the dice pool. You don’t have any tremendous talent when you default – quite the opposite in fact. Defaulting imposes a -1 dice pool modifier in addition to any other modifiers the situation demands. Some skills are too technically demanding to be defaulted. These are mentioned in the skill description.

### **Knowledge and <a name="_hlk209965146"></a>Language Skills**
- - All characters have **one\* language** that they know as their native language. No test is required for a character to communicate in their native language, and as such, the skill is **given for free** and does not have an associated skill rating.** *(**\***Two, if your character has taken the Bilingual quality.)*
- - Other Knowledge and/or Language skills are **purchased with** **bonus points**, separate to Karma,** equal to \
-   **2x (Intuition rating + Logic rating)**, disregarding any boosts from cyberware or bioware.
- - *Once these points have been spent, players can purchase additional Knowledge and/or Language skills, if desired, using Karma, per “Skill Karma Cost” table above.*

**Knowledge and Language skills** otherwise work in the same manner as all other Skills: they have corresponding numerical **ratings** to represent skill proficiency (see “What the Ratings Mean” above) and this rating is combined with an associated Attribute to determine the dice pool for tests.

**Knowledge and Language Skills points cost:** **1 bonus point per skill rating** (see “What the Ratings Mean” above)\
*(E.g. Rating 2 in Astronomy = 2 bonus points)*
### **Language Skills**
- - Language skills use **Intuition** as their linked Attribute.
- - When using Social skills in a foreign language, the language barrier hinders your character’s charms. You can’t add more dice from your Social skill than you have in the language you (attempt to) speak.
#### **Common Shadowrun Languages:** 
English, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, French, Italian, German, Mandarin, Arabic, Dine (Navajo), Lakota, Dakota, Sperethiel (Elven), Or’zet (Orcish)

|**Language Skill Tests**||
| :- | :- |
|Situation|Threshold|
|Universal concept (hunger, fear, bodily function)|1|
|Basic conversation (concerns of daily life)|1|
|Complex subject (special/limited interest topic)|2|
|Intricate subjects (almost any technical subject)|3|
|Obscure subject (very technical/rare knowledge)|4|
|Situation|Dice Pool Modifier|
|Speaking lingo (or variation of particular language)|-2|
|Using AR visual display help|+1 to +4|
### **Knowledge Skills**
There are four types of Knowledge skills:

- - **Academic** knowledge is information gained through formal education, whether from a school, tutor, university or other structured program. 
- - **Interests** include hobbies, experiences and personal interests of the individual character. 
- - **Professional** knowledge comes from an employer or professional organisation. 
- - **Street** knowledge includes everything a runner has picked up from life in the shadows, from drug prices to gang politics who pays the most for stolen goods.

When purchasing knowledge skills, a player should note which of these categories the skill belongs to so they know which **attribute** (see below) they will need to roll on their Knowledge Tests. Sometimes, Knowledge skills may straddle multiple categories. In these cases, choose the most appropriate category for the knowledge skill based on the character and how they would use it. For example, a Corporations Knowledge skill could fit in Professional, Academic or Street categories; a neo-anarchist with this skill would likely be focused on how corporate activities affect life on the street, so for this character it would be a Street skill, while for a boardroom executive it would be Professional.
#### **Common Shadowrun Knowledge Skills:**
**Academic Knowledges (LOG)**: Art, Astronomy, Biology, Economics, Engineering, History, Literature, Mathematics, Ornithology, Parabotany, Parazoology, Philosophy, Physics, Psychology, Religion, Zoology

**Interests Knowledges (INT)**: Anime and Manga, Classic Music, Club Music, Fashion, Gambling, Gardening, Matrix Games, Opera, Popular Culture, Popular Music, Sports, Trideo Shows, Vehicles

**<a name="_toc218024792"></a>QUALITIES**\

=========================================
Qualities help round out your character’s personality while also providing a range of benefits or penalties. 

|<p>There are two types of Qualities – </p><p>- - **Positive Qualities** cost Karma but provide gameplay bonuses.</p><p>- - *Players can spend a **maximum of 25 Karma** on Positive Qualities.*</p><p>- - **Negative Qualities** give bonus Karma but impose gameplay penalties.</p><p>- - *Players can gain a **maximum of 25 Karma** from Negative Qualities.*</p>|
| :- |

***Note:** After character creation, some Positive Qualities can be purchased during game play, while Negative Qualities may be awarded to the character by the gamesmaster based on events that take place in game.*
### **Positive Qualities**
**Agile Defender (Cost 3 Karma)**: Speed kills, but quickness and agility can be the key to avoiding a speedy death. The character can use their Agility attribute instead of their Willpower attribute while using Full Defence.

**Animal Empathy (Cost 3 Karma)**: Characters with this quality have a natural knack for working with animals. The character gets a +2 dice pool bonus for all tests involving the influence or control of an animal (including riding), including Awakened species. 

**Ambidextrous (Cost 4 Karma)**: The Ambidextrous character can handle object equally well with either hand. Without this quality, any action performed solely with the off-hand (e.g. firing a gun) suffers a -2 dice pool penalty.

**Aptitude (Cost 14 Karma)**: This is how you become even better than the best in the world. Every so often, there is a character who can exceed limitations and be truly exceptional in a particular skill. With this particular quality, the character can have one skill rated at 7 at character creation and may eventually build that skill up to rating 13.

**Astral Chameleon (Cost 10 Karma)**: With the Astral Chameleon quality, the character’s astral signature blends into the background of astral space and is difficult to detect. All signatures left by the character last only half as long as other astral signatures. Any individuals assensing astral signatures left behind by a character with this quality receive a -2 dice pool penalty for the Assensing Test. Only characters with a Magic rating and capable of leaving astral signatures may have this quality.

**Bilingual (Cost 5 Karma)**: A character with this quality reads, writes and speaks a second language fluently. They can list a second language as a native tongue. This quality can only be acquired at character creation; selecting it gives the character a second free language skill during character creation.

**Biocompatibility (Cost 5 Karma)**: Something about the character’s body is exceptionally accepting of either bioware or cyberware implants (choose one). Not only are the implants not rejected, but they seamlessly fit within the body, having less impact on its holistic integrity. In game terms, the Essence cost of implants of the particular chosen type are reduced by ten percent. This reduction is cumulative with the reduction offered by the chosen ‘ware’s grade, if any. This quality can only be chosen for bioware or cyberware. This quality may only be taken once.

**Blandness (Cost 8 Karma)**: This character blends into a crowd; they’re seldom noticed and easily forgotten. They are unremarkable in every aspect of physical appearance. Anyone attempting to describe the character cannot come up with anything more precise that “average height, average build, average hair, etc.” Increase the threshold for anyone to recall specific details about the character by 1. Individuals attempting to shadow or physically locate a character with Blandness quality in a populated setting receive a -2 dice pool penalty on all tests related to the search. The same penalty applies if they’re asking around about the person based on the individual’s physical appearance. The modifier does not, however, apply to magical or Matrix searches. This quality decreases Notoriety by 1. 

**Catlike (Cost 7 Karma)**: A character with this quality is gifted with an uncanny elegance, a stealthy gait, and an almost preternatural ability to move without making a sound. They also claim they land on their feet when dropped, though they tend not to let people test this. Add a +2 dice pool bonus to Sneaking skill tests.

**Codeslinger (Cost 10 Karma)**: Ones and zeroes are practically a native language to a Codeslinger. The character is adept at performing a particular Matrix action (which is selected when selecting this quality) and receives a +2 dice pool bonus to that Matrix action. This can only be selected for Matrix Actions that have a test associated with them.

**College Education (Cost 4 Karma)**: The halls of academe are well known to your character. Thanks to time spent actually studying while at college instead of partying, the character can buy Academic Knowledge skills at half price (rounded up) during character creation. After character creation, Academic Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.

**Cyber Singularity Seeker (Cost 12 Karma)**: In the Sixth World, many accept cyberware as a means to an end, as a way to augment their capacity. For most it is a trade-off between their sense of self and being more capable. For you, though, cyberware *is* the end. You believe that the more chrome you get, the closer you get to some sort of point of nirvana, of hitting a singularity where you blend man and machine to perfection.

The character gains +1 Willpower for every two full cyberlimb replacements they get (partial limb replacements don’t count), up to a maximum of +2 Willpower.

**Cynic (Cost 6 Karma)**: How many times does Mr Johnson have to screw you over before you just assume he’s lying to you? What about anyone else? You’ve been stabbed in the back so many times you’ve got little mirrors in your sunglasses to see them coming. You might be a downer, but no one gets the drop on you. How could they? You were expecting their sudden, inevitable betrayal all along. Anyone attempting a Social Test against you has a -1 dice pool penalty.

**Daredevil (Cost 6 Karma)**: Better to be lucky than good, when you’re living on the edge. A character with this quality is particularly lucky when it comes to doing the outrageous. Whenever the character performs an exceptionally daring action, they get two points of Edge back instead of one.

**Deep Resonance Connection (Cost 10 Karma)**: Technomancer only. Having known your abilities for longer than just about anyone else alive, dealing with these strange powers is second nature to you. You gain a +2 dice pool bonus when resisting Fading from any source.

**Drug Tolerant (Cost 6 Karma)**: The character has a higher-than-average tolerance for drugs (sometimes called Ozzy Osborne Syndrome). This could be due to a hardy constitution or a natural genetic mutation that allows for better absorption and filtering of foreign chemicals from their system. The character in question receives a +2 dice pool bonus to all Addiction Tests to resist addiction. They gain no bonus, however, for attempting to dry out after being addicted.

**Empathic Listener (Cost 10 Karma)**: Charming people always seem to know what to say. You might not be well-spoken, but you weren’t born yesterday either. A gut feeling, some honest empathy – you’ve got a little insight to make up for lack of social graces. If might not be pretty, but you can win people over by playing to exactly what they want to hear. Substitute Intuition for Charisma on Etiquette tests.

**Exceptional Attribute (Cost 14 Karma)**: The Exceptional Attribute quality is how you get to be a charismatic troll or the agile dwarf. It allows you to possess one attribute at a level one point above the metatype maximum limit. Exceptional Attribute also applies towards Special Attributes such as Magic and Resonance. Edge cannot be affected by this quality (but see Lucky). A character may only take Exceptional Attribute once.

**First Impression (Cost 11 Karma)**: The First Impression quality enables a character to slide easily into new environments, situations, groups and jobs. Whether infiltrating a gang, making contacts in a new city or wrangling an invite to a private meet, the character gains a temporary +2 dice pool bonus for relevant Social Tests such as Negotiation and Con during their first meeting. This modifier does not apply to second and subsequent encounters. This quality decreases Notoriety by 1.

**Gifted Healer (Cost 2 Karma)**: A character with the Gifted Healer quality is particularly adept at one of Stabilisation, Diagnosis or Treatment. They receive a +1 dice pool bonus whenever performing the selected test, whether by magical or mundane means.

**Good Looking and Knows It (Cost 10 Karma)**: If you’ve got it, flaunt it! Good genes, good fashion sense or a good plastic surgeon have blessed you with looks that turn heads. The good news? You can often get what you want just by virtue of that pretty face. The bad news? They won’t forget that face any time soon.

You receive +1 Notoriety. Additionally, Memory tests to remember you receive a +2 dice pool bonus. On the bright side, you can ignore 2 points of negative modifiers on any Social test.

**Guts (Cost 10 Karma)**: The character with Guts is the one most likely to stand and fight instead of freaking the hell out. Guts gives a character a +2 dice pool bonus on tests to resist fear and intimidation, including magically induced fear from spells or critter powers.

**Hawk Eye (Cost 3 Karma)**: Characters with the Hawk Eye quality have exceptionally keen natural vision. They can identify a face a block away without binoculars or spot a spent casing in a shadowy crack at five metres. Characters gain a +1 dice pool bonus to their Perception Tests and shift all Range Environmental modifiers up one category (e.g. Medium becomes Short). The quality is part of the character’s natural eyes and is not compatible with electronic vision enhancements and/or cyber- or bioware augmentations or replacements.

**High Pain Tolerance (Cost 7 Karma/Rating – Max Rating 3)**: High Pain Tolerance lets a character keep delivering the pain even if they’ve had plenty piled on their own head. A character with High Pain Tolerance can ignore one box of damage per rating point of this quality when calculating wound modifiers. This quality may not be used with the Pain Resistance adept power, pain editor bioware or damage compensator bioware.

**Honest Face (Cost 5 Karma)**: Who, me? Whether you sold bad cars to old ladies or spent a whole lot of time looking in the mirror getting ready for Friday night poker, you sure don’t look like a liar, particularly when you are lying. This doesn’t make you look innocent – just without guile. Good for selling lunar real estate. Better for convincing the interrogator you really don’t know anything else.

Whenever someone makes a Judge Intentions Test against you, you receive a +2 dice pool bonus to the opposing Charisma + Willpower Test.

**Immunity to Iocaine Powder (Cost 4 Karma)**: You have developed an immunity to the colourless, odorless and tasteless Iocaine Powder, among the world’s most deadly poisons.

**Indomitable (Cost 8 Karma/Rating – Max Rating 3)**: Bodies and minds have limits, but some people have the will to push right through those boundaries. For each level of Indomitable, a character receives a +1 increase to an Inherent limit of their choice (Mental, Physical or Social).

**Innocuous (Cost 5 Karma)**: Sure, a guy can be bland and unmemorable, but it’s something else altogether to disappear into a crowd. You know how to dress mundane, slouch your shoulders, pull your hat low and turn the right corner. You can vanish into the masses, hiding in plain sight or approach your prey with the herd. You gain a +2 dice pool bonus to Sneaking Tests to hide in a crowd.

**Lightning Reflexes (Cost 20 Karma)**: Some people are just born fast. This quality provides an unaugmented character the ability to react with astonishing speed. The character gains +1 to their Initiative rating and a bonus initiative die. They also receive a +1 dice pool bonus for all Defence Tests. This quality is not cumulative with any other Initiative enhancement, be it technological, chemical or magical.

**Lucky (Cost 12 Karma)**: The dice roll and the coin flips your character’s way more often than not, giving them the chance to drop jaws in amazement at their good fortune. Lucky allows a character to possess an Edge attribute one point higher than his metatype maximum. This quality may only be taken once. This quality decreases Notoriety by 1.

**Mentor Spirit (Cost 5 Karma)**: Everyone needs some help in life, even if it comes from someone relatively filmy and insubstantial. Mentor Spirit means the character follows a patron spirit that guides them in their practice of magic and provides certain advantages and disadvantages to their natural abilities. Each tradition has a different name for a mentor spirit. Hermetic mages prefer the term “mentor spirit”, while shamans use the word “totem” for the spirit that they follow. While the names may vary, the way the mentor works is consistent. This quality is only available to characters that possess a Magic attribute rating.

**Natural Athlete (Cost 7 Karma)**: A character with this quality has an innate combination of physical fitness, spatial awareness and natural athletic or gymnastic talent. While they may not be a world-class athlete and may require training to achieve peak performance, they are in prime physical shape for their size and weight class. Add a +2 dice pool bonus for Running and Acrobatics skill tests.

**Natural Hardening (Cost 10 Karma)**: This quality makes the character’s neural structure resistant to feedback. This give them 1 point of natural biofeedback filtering, which is cumulative with a Biofeedback Filter program or a technomancer’s firewall.

**Linked with the Matrix (Cost 8 Karma)**: The character’s living persona can act as a master device of a PAN, with a maximum number of slaves equal to their Resonance Rating x3.

**Perceptive. (Cost 5/10 Karma)**: The devil is in the details and you see those horns regularly. This quality is available at two levels. For 5 Karma, characters receive a +1 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests, including Astral and Matrix Perception. For 10 Karma, the modifier increases to +2.

**Photographic Memory (Cost 6 Karma)**: A character with this quality can often instantly recall facts, dates, numbers or anything else they have seen or heard. The character gains a +2 dice pool bonus to all Memory tests.

**Prototype Transhuman (Cost 10 Karma)**: You are an extremely rare, genetically crafted experimental post-human prototype. Unfortunately, this has its ups and downs. You were built better than a normal human, so you may pick up to 1 point of Essence of bioware (not cyberware). While you must pay the normal cost in nuyen for the bioware and otherwise follow all character creation rules, you do not incur *any* essence cost. So, essentially, you gain up to 1 point of free Essence to be used exclusively on bioware. These special organs were genetically grown into you from your inception – they are as much a natural part of you are your liver or heart.

However, the downside of being a rare, one-of-a-kind transhuman prototype is that, well, something is wrong with you. As part of this Quality, you *must* also pick one of the following negative qualities: Astral Beacon, Insomnia or Wanted. **You do not get the Karma bonus for this Negative Quality**. This quality can only be taken during character creation.

**Quick Healer (Cost 3 Karma)**: A character with the Quick Healer quality receives a +2 dice pool bonus to all Healing Tests made on them, including tests they make themselves and magical healing.

**Redliner (Cost 10 Karma)**: Any cyberlimbs you have installed are jacked-to-the-max, with safety limits disabled and performance overclocked beyond what the warranty normally covers, and that’s the way you like it. You receive +1 Strength and +1 Agility for every two full cyberarms or cyberlegs installed, up to a maximum of +2 for both attributes (sorry, no super centipede-man builds). The downside to pushing your ‘ware that hard, however, is that the strain is quite damaging. You lose three Physical Condition Monitor boxes per two full cyberarms and legs installed. Normally, every cyberlimb gives you one additional box, but with this quality, after two full limbs you end up with net one less box (i.e., -1 instead of +2).

**Resistance to Pathogens (Cost 4 Karma)**: A character with Resistance to Pathogens can fight off diseases more easily than other characters and receives a +1 dice pool bonus to those Resistance Tests. This quality stacks with the dwarf resistance to toxins and pathogens.

**Resistance to Toxins (Cost 4 Karma)**: A character with Resistance to Toxins can fight off toxins and drugs more easily than other characters and receives a +1 dice pool bonus to those Resistance Tests. This quality stacks with the dwarf resistance to toxins and pathogens.

**Resistance to Toxins and Pathogens (Cost 8 Karma)**: A character with this quality can fight off diseases, toxins and drugs more easily than other characters and receives a +1 dice pool bonus to those Resistance Tests. This quality stacks with the dwarf resistance to toxins and pathogens.

**Restricted Gear (Cost 10 Karma)**: Right place, right time, right friend or the stars aligned. No matter the reason, the character has managed to acquire or get a line on one piece of really hard-to-find gear they absolutely had to have. A character may start the game with one piece of gear usually unavailable at character creation. They do, however, have to pay any extra thirty percent for the item.

**School of Hard Knocks (Cost 4 Karma)**: The streets were this character’s classroom. Thanks to all the time spent trying to stay one step ahead oof the next guy, and knowing that knowledge is power on the streets, the character can buy Street Knowledge skills at half price (rounded up) during character creation. After character creation, Street Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.

**Shoot First, Don’t Ask Questions (Cost 3 Karma)**: Your lifestyle doesn’t always you the luxury of checking all the facts before diving right in. As a result, you’ve honed your reflexes in order to survive and no longer allow yourself to think before you shoot; you just go for the kill.

Whenever you succeed at a Surprise Test, increase your initiative score by the number of total hits rolled on the test. This bonus only applies to the first turn of combat. If additional Surprise Tests occur later in combat, the bonus will trigger based on this new Surprise Test, on the next turn after that Surprise Test. This quality also reduces the threshold for quick drawing a weapon by 1.

**Speed Demon (Cost 3 Karma)**: Pushing your vehicle to its limits makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, but in a good way. You feel alive, alert and ready to do anything. This increased intensity gives you a +1 dice pool bonus to Pilot Tests for a vehicle that is moving at a speed of 3 or higher (4 for aircraft). Note that your character must either be directly in the vehicle they are piloting or jacked in; the bonus does not apply to vehicles that are simply being piloted remotely.

**Spike Resistance (Cost 10 Karma/Rating – Max Rating 3)**: Characters with this quality have an inherent resistance to harmful forms of biofeedback such as black IC, dump shock, black hammer, etc. For every rating (up to three), the character gains a +1 dice pool bonus to resist damage from harmful biofeedback.

**Spirit Affinity (Cost 7 Karma)**: Available only to magic users, the Spirit Affinity quality allows a character to be attuned to one type of spirit. These spirits find the character interesting, are drawn to them and are more inclined to assist them. They may be reluctant to attack the character and if forced to do so they are likely to use nonlethal power. Watchers and minions to not count for this quality as they are constructed and are not summoned like normal spirits. Spirit Affinity provides magicians with 1 additional spirit service for each spirit of that type and it also provides a +1 dice pool modifier for Binding Tests.

Magic users may possess this quality for a type of spirit that is not part of their magical tradition.

**Technical School Education (Cost 4 Karma)**: All your schoolbooks focus on the practical and real-life working world. Thanks to time spent being formally educated in a technical school, the character can buy Professional Knowledge skills at half price (rounded up) during character creation. After character creation, Professional Knowledge skill ranks of 3 or higher receive a 1 Karma cost reduction for each rank.

**Too Pretty to Hit (Cost 3 Karma)**: It’s more about force of personality than actually being pretty – sometimes a character just has a presence about them that keeps people from shooting straight. The character can use their Charisma attribute instead of their Willpower attribute while using Full Defence.

**Tough as Nails (Cost 5 Karma/Rating – Max Rating 3)**: “Hit me!” is your favourite phrase. Each rating provides one additional box to either the character’s Physical or Stun Condition monitor. This quality can be taken up to 3 times for Physical and 3 times for Stun.

**Toughness (Cost 9 Karma)**: Characters with the Toughness quality shrug off damage more easily than others. Such characters gain a +1 dice pool bonus to their Body when making Damage Resistance tests.

**Uncanny Healer (Cost 12 Karma)**: This character has always been a fast healer, recovering from injuries with almost supernatural speed. Characters who embrace augmentation soon discover that it interferes with their unnatural healing ability. The character adds their current Essence attribute as a dice pool modifier to all Natural Recovery Healing Tests for both Stun and Physical damage. This does not affect magical healing or First Aid tests performed by others. This quality cannot be combined with Quick Healer.

**Watch the Suit (Cost 3 Karma)**: You paid good nuyen for a Starlight gown. There’s no way you’re going to let this clown bleed all over it. You’ve got the presence of mind and the little dextrous tricks to get in a tousle and still come out looking good. This prevents any Stun damage from marring your appearance. Physical damage will still draw blood and leave cuts, burns or worse that you can’t avoid. You never receive negative dice pool penalties to Etiquette tests for looking roughed up after a fight in which you did not take Physical damage and your appearance won’t suspicion that you were recently involved in an altercation.

**Will to Live (<a name="_hlk201588261"></a>Cost 3 Karma/Rating – Max Rating 3)**: For each rating point in Will to Live, the character gains 1 additional Damage Overflow Box. These additional boxes only allow the character to sustain additional damage before dying; they do not raise the threshold at which the character becomes unconscious or incapacitated, nor do they affect modifiers from the damage the character has taken.
### **Negative Qualities**
**Accident Prone (Bonus 4 Karma)**: This driving thing – it may not be for you. You have a talent for steering any vehicle you control into whatever wall, tree or other vehicle may be nearby. You receive a -2 dice pool penalty on any tests involved in directing a vehicle.

**Addiction – Alcohol, Mild (Bonus 4 Karma)**: A character with this quality is hooked on alcohol. This quality increases Notoriety by 1. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. A craving occurs at least every two weeks. Alcohol has an addiction rating of 3 and an addiction threshold of 2. This level may be increased if the character has augmentations. At the lower end of the spectrum, it is easier to hide the effects of this Addiction.

If a character fails their Withdrawal Test, they suffer symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and consume alcohol to find relief. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -2 dice pool penalty to all their Physical-attribute-based tests. If the character succeeds on their Withdrawal Test, they do not suffer withdrawal symptoms and do not need alcohol until their next Withdrawal Test. They are able to stay clean for now.

**Addiction – Betel Gum, Mild (Bonus 4 Karma)**: A character with this quality is hooked on betel gum. This quality increases Notoriety by 1. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. A craving occurs at least every two days. Betel Gum has an addiction rating of 1 and an addiction threshold of 2. This level may be increased if the character has augmentations. At the lower end of the spectrum, it is easier to hide the effects of this Addiction.

If a character fails their Withdrawal Test, they suffer symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and chew betel gum to find relief. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -2 dice pool penalty to all their Mental-attribute-based tests. If the character succeeds on their Withdrawal Test, they do not suffer withdrawal symptoms and do not need betel gum until their next Withdrawal Test. They are able to stay clean for now.

**Addiction – Soykaf, Moderate (Bonus 9 Karma)**: A character with this quality is hooked on soykaf. This quality increases Notoriety by 1. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. A craving occurs at least every two days. Soykaf has an addiction rating of 1 and an addiction threshold of 2. This level may be increased if the character has augmentations. At the lower end of the spectrum, it is easier to hide the effects of this Addiction.

If a character fails their Withdrawal Test, they suffer symptoms of withdrawal (nausea, the shakes and headaches) and must actively seek out and consume soykaf to find relief. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -4 dice pool penalty to all of the character’s Physical-attribute-based tests. If the character succeeds on their Withdrawal Test, they do not suffer withdrawal symptoms and do not need soykaf until their next Withdrawal Test. They are able to stay clean for now.

**Addiction – Gambling, Moderate (Bonus 9 Karma)**: A character with this quality is hooked on gambling. This quality increases Notoriety by 1. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. A craving occurs at least every two weeks. This frequency may be increased if the character has augmentations. At the lower end of the spectrum, it is easier to hide the effects of this Addiction.

If a character fails their Withdrawal Test, they suffer symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and engage in gambling to find relief. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms (insomnia, poor concentration and depression), apply a -4 dice pool penalty to all of the character’s Mental-attribute-based tests. If the character succeeds on their Withdrawal Test, they do not suffer withdrawal symptoms and does not need the substance or to participate in that habit until their next Withdrawal Test. They are able to stay clean for now.

**Addiction – Jazz, Severe (Bonus 20 Karma)**: A character with this quality is hooked on the narcotic, jazz. This quality increases Notoriety by 1. Addictions get worse over prolonged periods of time without treatment. A craving occurs at least every two days. Jazz has an addiction rating of 8 and an addiction threshold of 3. This level may be increased if the character has augmentations. At the lower end of the spectrum, it is easier to hide the effects of this Addiction.

If a character fails their Withdrawal Test, they suffer symptoms of withdrawal and must actively seek out and use jazz to find relief. While the character is suffering withdrawal symptoms, apply a -4 dice pool penalty to all of the character’s Mental-attribute-based tests and apply a -4 dice pool penalty to all of the character’s Physical-attribute-based tests. If the character succeeds on their Withdrawal Test, they do not suffer withdrawal symptoms and does not need jazz until their next Withdrawal Test. They are able to stay clean for now.

**Allergy – Adhesives (Bonus 10 Karma)**: A character with this quality is allergic to adhesives. Duct tape, glue and even band-aids and slap patches cause a strong allergic reaction. Swelling and a long-lasting rash that is discomforting and distracting is the result of skin contact with adhesives. This applies a -2 dice pool penalty to the character’s Physical Tests until healed.

**Allergy – Pollutants (Bonus 10 Karma)**: A character with this quality is allergic to common pollutants. In many places the very air causes a strong allergic reaction. Red and sore eyes, a scratchy throat and coughing as well as uncontrollable sneezing are common reactions to exposure to pollutants. This applies a -2 dice pool penalty to the character’s Physical Tests until time is spent recovering away from the polluted environments.

**Allergy – Soy (Bonus 15 Karma)**: A character with this quality is allergic to soy. After ingesting any product containing soy, they experience stomach cramps and extreme pain, sometimes coughing up blood. This applies a -4 dice pool penalty to the character’s Physical Tests until they vomit enough of it up, their stomach is pumped or it passes through their system. Skin contact with soy products will cause a rash and swelling and apply a -2 dice pool penalty to the character’s Physical Tests until healed. Furthermore, the lifestyle cost of the character is increased by 20%.

**Antipathy (Bonus 8 Karma)**: Your parents always told you to think about how others feel, but whether you want to or not, you don’t know how. You suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to all opposed Social Tests.

**Astral Beacon (Bonus 10 Karma)**: The astral signature of a character with the Astral Beacon quality is like, well, a beacon – highly visible on the astral plane. The signature also lasts twice as long as it would without the Astral Beacon quality and others assensing it receive a -1 threshold on their Assensing Test for gathering information about it. Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.

**Bad Luck (Bonus 12 Karma)**: The character is cursed – their own luck often turns against them. When the character uses Edge, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the point of Edge is spent, but is has the exact opposite effect intended. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Big Regret (Bonus 5 Karma)**: Mistakes happen. Sometime in the character’s past they did something serious that they regret; maybe they spent time as a bunraku puppet, maybe they were part of a major political affair or they were involved in the wrong corporate project, but it has to be something truly unpleasant (gamesmaster’s discretion). The character decreases their Social Limit by 3 against anyone who knows about their past. This could result in a case of blackmail if the wrong person knows the truth. The character cannot buy off this quality unless it becomes public, at which point they gain 1 point of Notoriety and must buy off the quality as soon as possible.

**Code of Honour – Warrior’s Code (Bonus 15 Karma)**: The character has a binding Code of Honour; it’s a matter of unwavering principle. The character maintains a strict sense of personal honour. This means they will not kill an unarmed person, nor take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenceless. The character loses Karma each time the code is broken through your actions, or decision not to act.

**Codeblock (Bonus 10 Karma)**: A character with the Codeblock quality always has trouble with a particular Matrix action. They receive a -2 dice pool modifier any time they attempt that type of Matrix action. Codeblock only applies to Matrix actions with an associated test; it does not apply to actions that do not require a test. Characters cannot apply Codeblock toward Matrix actions they are never likely to take.

**Combat Paralysis (Bonus 12 Karma)**: A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat; this includes astral combat and cybercombat. On the character’s first Initiative Test, the character divides their Initiative Score for that Combat Turn in half (rounded up). In subsequent Combat Turns, the character may roll their normal Initiative. Combat Paralysis also gives the character a -3 dice pool modifier on Surprise Tests. If the character must make a Composure Test (CHA + WIL) while under fire or in a similar combat situation, the gamesmaster applies a +1 threshold modifier. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Cyber-Snob (Bonus 12 Karma)**: There are augmentations and then there are augmentations, chummer. If you’re gonna stick a chunk of metal or hunk of flesh inside your body, it’s going to be nothing but the best! A character with Cyber-Snob will not accept any augmentations of a grade lower than betaware. A character must have at least 1 point worth of Essence of betaware-grade cyberware or bioware to be able to take this quality.

**Designated Omega (Bonus 5 Karma)**: It’s safer when someone else is giving the orders, isn’t it? That way, if it goes sideways, it’s not your fault. Or maybe you just don’t trust yourself to do the job right or you freeze under pressure. As long as you’re working support or moving with your designated herd, you’re just fine. If you’re put in a position where the team depends on you or you need to make a critical decision, you freeze up. You take a -2 dice pool penalty to all Leadership tests, whether initiating or resisting.

**Diabetic (Bonus 15 Karma)**: A chronic medication condition that requires daily insulin injections to manage. The character must daily succeed in a Body + Body (3) Test or their illness will flair, causing a -3 negative dice pool modifier affecting all tests. If the character keeps up with the necessary medical treatments (daily insulin injections), the threshold for this test is reduced to 1. The treatment costs 100¥/day.

**Did You Just Call Me Dumb? (Bonus 3 Karma)**: The character can’t resist camouflaging insults into well-spoken words. The character gets the satisfaction of feeling superior to everyone. Unfortunately, once in a while, people will notice and get pretty upset. Any Glitch rolled on a Social Test always counts as a Critical Glitch.

**Dimmer Bulb (Bonus 5 Karma/Rating – Max Rating 3)**: Maybe it was one too many hits to the head, maybe the character’s mother dropped them as a baby or maybe they never got into that whole “thinking” thing but whatever the cause, the character does not tend to shine in the mental arena. For every rating of this quality the character suffers a -1 dice pool penalty on all tests involving Logic or Intuition.

**Elevated Stress (Bonus 8 Karma)**: Years of having mainstream society look down on you has taken its toll, as has the long-term stress associated with it. You take a -1 dice pool penalty to any Addiction and Toxin Resistance Tests due to the strain on your health.

**Elf Poser (Bonus 6 Karma)**: The Elf Poser is a human character who wants to be an elf. They associate with elves as much as possible, talk like elves and alters their appearance to resemble an elf. Characters with this quality may undergo cosmetic surgery to get elf ears and elf eyes and they may successfully pass as elves and avoid any negative Social modifiers associated with being a non-elf.

Real elves consider Elf Posers an embarrassment, many humans think of them as sellouts and other metatypes generally consider posers to be pathetic. If an elf discovers the character’s secret, the elf is likely to treat them with contempt and hostility. An outed elf poser may also face stigma from prejudiced humans as a “race traitor”.

Only human characters may take the Elf Poser quality. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Family Curse (Bonus 5 Karma)**: Your parent(s) liked their drugs. A lot. So did theirs, and their parents before them. To say that addiction runs in the family is like saying Lone Star officers enjoy clubbing punks. When making Addiction Tests, the character receives a -2 dice pool penalty.

**Illiterate (Bonus 5 Karma)**: Though literacy is not really necessary thanks to the advances of the Sixth World, most folks can at least sound out “See Spot run”. Whether because they grew up in the wild (urban, rural or otherwise) or just never had the opportunity, the character cannot read a lick. They can ask others, use an agent program or get software on their commlink to scan and read things aloud, but anyone aware of this intellectual deficit will look negatively on the character, reducing their Social limit by 1. The illiterate character also suffers a -2 dice pool penalty when working with computer/commlink systems and electronics other than their own due to their unfamiliarity with their iconography. Also, during character creation, the character cannot choose any Knowledge skill that may have required even the most minimal of reading and during gameplay all Knowledge skills that require reading cost double the Karma for the character until they learn to read and buys off this quality.

**Incompetent (Bonus 5 Karma)**: An Incompetent character possesses a total lack of knowledge or ability with a certain Active skill group – or, perhaps worse, they have some vague knowledge of the skills contained in the group, but they have neither the coordination nor the comprehension to come anywhere close to carrying it off properly. No matter how much effort they put into this area, they simply cannot grasp it – it would take a miracle for them to somehow, someday, advance to the level of “poor” in those skills.

Incompetent may not be applied to Language or Knowledge skills. The Incompetent character is treated as having skill level of “unaware” for all skills in the skill group.

In some cases, a Success Test may be required for tasks most people take for granted. Characters may not possess that skill group for which they have the Incompetent quality. If gear grants a bonus or requires the use of a specific skill in which the character is Incompetent, the character gains no benefits from the gear.

Gamesmasters are free to reject any choices that would prove irrelevant or exploitative in actual play, such as Incompetent: Outdoors in a campaign based entirely inside an arcology. (This should go without saying, but just in case: Characters may never choose Incompetent for any skill group that they are physically incapable of using. A non-magician cannot take Incompetent in Sorcery, Conjuring or Enchanting; a non-technomancer cannot be Incompetent in a skill that requires Resonance; and so on.)

Incompetent may be purchased only once. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Insomnia (Bonus 10 Karma)**: A character with the Insomnia quality has trouble falling asleep and seldom feels well rested. Usually, this is only an annoyance. For runners, however, this can become a major problem when they are dependent on being able to rest at every opportunity to remain sharp. Insomnia can lengthen the amount of time it takes for a character to recover Stun damage.

Before a character rolls their Body + Willpower to recover Stun damage, the character rolls an Intuition + Willpower (4) Test. If the character succeeds on this test, the character is not impeded by Insomnia and the character regains Stun damage as normal. They also regain 1 point of Edge after a night of restful sleep. If the character fails, double the amount of time it normally would take for a character to recover their Stun damage. In addition, Edge is not regained after restful sleep for up to another 24 hours.

**Implant-Induced Immune Deficiency (Bonus 5 Karma)**: Cyberware and bioware users sometimes suffer from a number of health problems as the natural balance of their metabolisms is thrown off by modified organs and systems. The demands of their augmented biologies and the body’s continuous attempts to adjust to the implants can lead to decreased immunity to pathogens, poisons and other compounds. Characters with this quality suffer a dice pool modifier of -2 on all Body Tests to resist the effects of diseases, drugs, toxins and other compounds (including Physical Addiction Tests and Disease Resistance Tests). This quality is only available to characters with bioware or cyberware implants and an Essence of 5 or less.

**Lack of Focus (Bonus 6 Karma)**: Characters suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have difficulty focusing on a single subject for long. When making any Extended Test with an interval greater than five minutes and shorter than one day or if repeated simple tests are made within a period of time (such as Perception Tests during surveillance), the character must make a Composure (CHA + WIL) (3) Test each interval after the first. The character’s Composure dice pool is cumulatively reduced by 1 for each of these tests, like any other Extended Test.

Failing the Composure Test indicates the character can no longer focus and must take a break for a minimum of 1 interval, plus any other consequences that result. After the break, the character’s Composure dice pool is refreshed and the process starts over again.

**Lightweight (Bonus 6 Karma)**: On the bright side, this quality means it’s easy, and cheap, to get drunk. On the downside, it takes far less to get a person addicted to the various types of chemical drugs on the market. The Addiction Rating of any substance on the Addiction Table or any other related tables is 2 levels higher for the character.

**Low Pain Tolerance (Bonus 9 Karma)**: Characters with Low Pain Tolerance are particularly sensitive to pain; they incur a -1 wound modifier for every 2 boxes of cumulative damage, instead of the normal 3 boxes. This affects both Physical and Stun damage tracks.

**Motion Sickness (Bonus 4 Karma)**: Yes, there is a strong benefit from being able to move from place to place, but if your travelling comes with too much, well, *motion*, your stomach starts doing flip-flops. Any time you are in a vehicle that is effectively accelerating at a rate of 3 or higher or moving at a Speed of 4 or higher, you experience Nausea until the vehicle’s Speed or Acceleration drops. Once the vehicle movement drops, the Nausea disappears in (12-Body) minutes.

**No Man Left Behind (Bonus 7 Karma)**: You can’t leave a fallen comrade behind to be taken by the enemy. Whether they are dead or just knocked out, you won’t leave them to the wolves. Any time a team member falls (even one you don’t particularly like), make a Composure (CHA + WIL) (4) Test. Success means you’ve overcome this urge to save your fallen comrade (though you can still do so if you choose); failure means you needs to do everything within your power, up to and including self-sacrifice, to get your companion out of the hot zone and to safety.

**Oblivious (Bonus 6 Karma)**: The character with this quality fails to notice the troll in the corner with the Panther Cannon… even after they’ve fired it! They suffer a -2 dice pool penalty on all Perception Tests, including standard, Astral and Matrix.

**Ork Poser (Bonus 6 Karma)**: Influenced by Goblin Rock or over-hyped orxploitation trends, an Ork Poser is an elf or human character who alters their appearance to appear as an Ork. Various cosmetic biomods – tusk implants, steroids, larynx alterations, etc. – allow them to successfully pass as an ork. Ork posers are an embarrassment to many orks, but some tolerate, if not appreciate, the compliment behind the effort. This means an ork who discovers the character’s secret may either become very hostile toward them or be willing to let the character join the “family” – provided they pass an appropriate hazing ritual to prove their “orkness”. An outed ork poser may also face stigma from other humans or elves as “race traitors”, if those humans/elves harbour any prejudice against orks. Only humans and elves may take the Ork Poser quality. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Reality Impaired (Bonus 5 Karma)**: The character is so accustomed to the Matrix and AR that they have lost any sense of what is real and what is virtual. The character tends to mistake real objects for AROs, and vice-versa, resulting in quirky mannerisms such as touching people in an attempt to call up information windows, ducking to avoid AR banners or trying to delete physical objects. This bizarre behaviour results in a -1 dice pool modifier to all Social Skill Tests when in the physical world (as opposed to VR or astral space).

**Simsense Vertigo (Bonus 5 Karma)**: Characters who suffer from Simsense Vertigo experience feelings of disorientation whenever they work with augmented reality, virtual reality or simsense (including smartlinks, simrigs and image links). Such characters receive a -2 dice pool penalty to all tests when interacting with AR, VR or simsense.

**SINner [Layered] (Bonus 5 to 25 Karma)**: There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner [Layered] quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to use active mod to display their SINs. A SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of **fake SINs** just so they can participate in society.

**National SIN (Bonus 5 Karma)**

At the 5 Karma level, the character has what is called a National SIN. The character’s parents were legal citizens of a nation (such as the UCAS or CAS) and they have the right to vote, qualify for passports issued by their nation, enlist in the national military or work in the national government. A National SIN is required for any national security clearance or any form of national military career. A character with a National SIN pays fifteen percent of their gross income in taxes. They are also in no way connected to any of the megacorporations. The main drawback to having a legal National SIN is the character is in the system. The nation in the player character’s background has the character’s biometric data (DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans) on file and that biometric data is shared with law enforcement agencies through the Global SIN Registry. This makes is much easier to track a character should a job go sideways. Also, nations typically sell the personal information tied to the character’s SIN to corporations. Those with a legal SIN get nearly three times as much spam as those who don’t have a SIN or rely on fake SINs and the spam messages they receive are disturbingly tailored to their preferences (based on their buying and browsing habits).

**Criminal SIN (Bonus 10 Karma)**

At the 10 Karma level, the character has a Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National); their Criminal SIN replaces any previous SIN. At some point in their life, the character was arrested and served time for a felony-level offence and was branded a criminal for the rest of their life. They are legally required to use active mode to display their Criminal SIN at all times; failure to do so is a felony and can lead to re-incarceration. They are shunned by law-abiding society. Law-abiding citizens will, if they must, deal with a SINless character before they’d have any interaction with a known criminal. With their Criminal SIN, the character will experience prejudiced views, suspicion and/or open hostility from most people with SINs. They will often be denied entry to certain locations (high-end stores, car dealerships, museums, galleries, etc.) and will have difficulty finding legal employment. They can expect to be brought in and held up to 48 hours for questioning any time a crime is committed in their area. The judicial system in 2075 is more an assembly line than institution of justice. Suspects are treated as guilty unless proven innocent, plausible circumstantial evidence is often sufficient for conviction and sentencing has more to do with the judge’s mood than the crime. In this environment it’s likely the cops will be more interested in closing the case than solving any crime; they may try to pin crimes on the character with the Criminal SIN whether or not they had anything to do with it. Some degree of “adjusting” facts and “interpreting” witness accounts to support allegations is common; fabricating evidence, if only to meet conviction productivity goals, is not rare. Magic users tend to receive much harsher treatment from the judicial system than mundane criminals. If the character is a magic user with a Criminal SIN, they are registered with local law enforcement. They can expect regular – but usually not scheduled – checks to confirm their address and to ensure they are not using forbidden spell formula, foci or other magical gear. The nation or corporation that issued the Criminal SIN will keep close tabs on the character. If they fail to update residential information or appear in any way to be trying to evade their oversight, they are subject to arrest. They are also required to pay a fifteen percent tax on their gross income to the entity that issued their Criminal SIN. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Corporate Limited SIN (Bonus 15 Karma)**

At the 15 Karma level, the character has the Corporate Limited SIN; they have somehow gained a position in a megacorporation from the outside. They may have been hired as a wageslave (or been the minor child of a person hired as a wageslave) or perhaps brought in by someone in the megacorp who saw advantage in their skill, talent, area of expertise or some other useful attribute. Under most circumstances, the Corporate Limited SIN replaces any National SIN. Their Corporate Limited SIN becomes part of the Global SIN Registry, to which law enforcement agencies and security corporations alike have access. Many of these Corporate Limited SINs record whether or not the character is Awakened. With the Corporate Limited SIN, the character can be gainfully employed by the issuing megacorporation as a wageslave, a low-ranking member of the corporation’s security services or an enlisted member of the corporation’s military. Though they could have a secret-level security clearance to perform their duties, they cannot rise to a leadership position, become an officer or be part of the megacorporation’s Special Forces (such as the Red Samurai). As a group, characters that possess Corporate Limited SINs are believed to either know something valuable about the inner workings of the megacorporation or have a skill set rival megacorps would want; as such they are considered valid targets for extraction, even if they are no longer active with the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Limited SIN experience prejudice and hostility from those in the shadows who are SINless. The SINless believe the corporations deliberately keep them poor and powerless so they can be exploited. The character with the Corporate Limited SIN may find themselves being personally blamed for their corporation’s actions – protesting they have no real authority and no connection with the actions in question usually does little good. To the SINless and neo-anarchists the character with the Corporate Limited SIN has sold out and chosen a corrupt and oppressive system over their own people. They character pays twenty percent of their gross income in taxes to their megacorporation.

**Corporate SIN (Bonus 25 Karma)**

At the 25 Karma level is the Corporate Born SIN. The character with this ID was probably born into a mega corporation or belonged to one when it achieved extraterritoriality. At least one of their parents probably had the Corporate Born SIN as well. They grew up in a corporation, their social involvement, education and almost every aspect of their life was managed by the corporation. Their skills and aptitudes were evaluated constantly and they were groomed for the career path to which they were best suited; their whole world was the corporation. Characters with the Corporate Born SIN had the potential and the opportunity to advance through the corporation hierarchy. They could have been a department administrator, a finance strategist, an agent of corporate intelligence, an officer in a megacorp’s military or even a member of Corporate Special Forces (Renraku’s Red Samurai or Ares’ Firewatch). With a Corporate Born SIN, they could have enjoyed top-secret clearance within the corporation and access to nearly unlimited resources. Then something happened. An unforgivably costly mistake, the machinations of a rival, a supervisor in need of a scapegoat – something pushed the character out of the corporation and into the cold and unforgiving shadows. In the shadows, a SIN that had been the key to opportunity is now a deadly liability. Most in the shadows see the Corporate Born as the privileged few, the aristocrats in the armoured limousines who look down on them, oppress them, exploit them and deny them their basic rights. If the SINless discover the character’s Corporate Born SIN, reactions will range from deep suspicion to violent hostility; serious injury and death are real possibilities. The character’s loyalty to their corporation is never questioned, which can be an insurmountable liability in a culture that works against the megacorps. Would-be runners have been killed for holding Corporate Born SINs. Fortunately, Corporate Born records are limited to the megacorporation that generated them. Files in the Global SIN Registry can confirm they have a valid SIN, but do not contain any additional information. Those with Corporate Born SINs pay a tax of ten percent of their gross income to their corporation.

**Social Appearance Anxiety (Bonus 3 Karma)**: Like the old flatvid once said, “I can afford a blemish on my character, but not on my clothes.” In the ages of style over substance, you need to look your best at all times if you’re going to compete. Problem is, you’ve come to depend on it. When you aren’t clean, coiffed and cutting, you become very aware of your own flaws, resulting in a -1 dice pool penalty to all Social rolls.

**Thrill Seeker (Bonus 4 Karma)**: It’s all about the rush. The character will always take the most dangerous and risky option in any situation if they don’t succeed at a Composure (Charisma + Willpower) (2) Test. There is a slight payoff, as the adrenaline rush provides a +1 to their Initiative Score for 5 Combat Turns (meaning that is how long the bonus lasts, not that the character gets an additional bonus each turn).

**Ugly and Doesn’t Care (Bonus 10 Karma)**: Fell out the ugly tree, blah blah, you’ve heard it all before. And you know what? You don’t care anymore! If people are going to judge you by your looks, then they can kiss your ugly ass. You’re not afraid to get a broken nose or a black eye. There’s nowhere to go but up. Reduce your attribute maximum for Charisma by 1 and your starting Charisma by 1 (to a minimum of 1).

**Uncouth (Bonus 14 Karma)**: The character with the Uncouth quality has difficulty interacting with others. They act impulsively, overreact to any perceived provocation and tend to do whatever pops into their head without considering the consequences (i.e. flipping off Mr Johnson, calling a drunk troll a “Trog” or responding to casual trash talk from a rival runner by punching them in the face). All Social Tests made by the character to resist acting improperly or impulsively receive a -2 dice pool modifier.

Additionally, the cost for learning or improving Social Skills is double for Uncouth characters (including at character creation) and they may never learn any Social skill groups. Uncouth characters are treated as “unaware” in any Social Skills that they do not possess a Rating 1 or higher. They may be required to make Success Tests for social situations that pose no difficulty for normal characters. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Uneducated (Bonus 8 Karma)**: An Uneducated character is not mentally impaired – they just never had the opportunity to learn. Whether because they are their family were isolated squatters or were SIN-less or otherwise underprivileged, they were denied access to the education system. They have only a rudimentary knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic.

Characters with the Uneducated quality are considered “unaware” in Technical, Academic Knowledge and Professional Knowledge skills they do not possess and they may not default on skill tests for those skills. They may also be required to make Success Tests for ordinary tasks that the typical sprawl-dweller takes from granted. Additionally, the Karma cost for learning new skills or specialisations (or for improving existing ones) in these categories is doubled compared to the normal cost (including at character creation) and it’s possible the character will never learn some skill groups belonging to these categories. This quality increases Notoriety by 1.

**Wanted (Bonus 10 Karma)**: It feels good to be wanted, or maybe not. Though most runners are probably wanted for questioning in a few cases, this is something different. The character may have a bounty on their head or a contract for their death. The character will have to frequently deal with someone coming for them or finding out about the bounty and using it against them.



**<a name="_toc218024793"></a>MOVEMENT**\

========================================
Getting from one place to another, especially from one piece of cover to another or closing the distance on an opponent, is important. Characters have three types of movement: Walking, Running and Sprinting.

A character’s movement for an entire Combat Turn (meaning total movement for *all* Initiative Passes, not *each* Initiative Pass) is based on their Run Rate, which is determined by metatype. Walk rate determines the farthest a character can move during a Combat Turn before they are considered to be Running.

It’s important to point out that “run” does not mean bolt as fast as you can; that’s sprinting. Think of running as a trained combat hustle or a jog, something to get you to another point quickly but still leave you able to perform other actions, albeit with a penalty. Sprinting is exactly that, running as fast as you can from point A to point B.

|**Metatype**|**Walk Rate**|**Run Rate**|**Sprint Increase**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Dwarf, Troll**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+1m/hit|
|**Elf, Human, Ork**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+2m/hit|
### **Standard Movement**
**Walking and running**: The Movement Rates (Walk and Run) for each metatype are the distance the character can move during their Combat Turn. As soon as the character exceeds their Walk rate, they are considered Running until the end of the Combat Turn and incur any penalties or benefits of running. Running characters must use a Bonus Action each Initiative Pass they are considered running.

Characters cannot exceed their calculated Run Rate in a Combat Turn without making a Sprinting Test.
#### **Running Modifiers:** 
Characters who are running take a -2 dice pool penalty to all actions performed while running (except for Sprinting). 

Characters charging into melee combat gain a +4 dice pool bonus (making a net bonus of +2 when combined with the general penalty for running) when running into melee combat.

Characters making a ranged attack against a running opponent suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to their attack test.

Characters making a ranged attack against a sprinting opponent suffer a -4 dice pool penalty to their attack test.
### **Sprinting**
Characters may attempt to increase their running distance by performing a Sprint Action during their Action Phase. In this action, they make a Running + Strength [Physical] Test. Each hit increases the distance a character can move in a Combat Turn by either 1 metre (for dwarves and trolls) or 2 metres (for elves, humans and orks). Characters are allowed a maximum number of Sprinting Tests equal to half their Running skill per Combat Turn (rounded up). Sprinting characters also suffer fatigue if they sprint for too long.
### **Swimming**
Swimming is a Complex Action. A swimming character can move a number of metres in a Combat turn equal to the average of their Agility and Strength. You can take a Bonus Action to “sprint” with a Swimming + Strength [Physical] Test, adding 1 metre per hit or 2 metres per hit if you’re an elf or troll. Swimming on the surface of water or under it does not affect this rate of speed. As with the Running skill, swimmers suffer from fatigue after an extended time.

If you’re just trying to keep afloat, you can tread water. You can tread water for a number of minutes equal to the average of your Strength and Body rating. At the end of this time, make a Simple Swimming + Strength [Physical] (2) Test. Success means you can keep treading water for the same amount of time before another test; failure means you slip and take 1 box of Stun damage that you can’t resist.
### **Jumping**
Jumping is done from a running or standing position. Running leaps get more distance than standing jumps do, if you have enough room to get up to full speed. Make an Acrobatics + Agility Test, applying any appropriate modifiers. You jump a base distance of 20 centimetres multiplied by the total of your Agility and Strength and for every hit you get on this test, you jump 40 centimetres from a standing jump or 80 centimetres from a running jump in addition to. No matter how many hits you get, you can’t jump farther than your Agility x1.3 metres (net hits beyond this mean you did it with *style*).

For a vertical jump, it’s the same test, but with base height of 5 centimetres multiplied by the total of your Agility and Strength and for every hit you get on this test, you jump 5 centimetres higher.
### **Climbing**
The Acrobatics skill is applied to both *assisted* and *unassisted* climbing tasks. Assisted climbing is accomplished with specialised gear such as ropes and harnesses. Assisted climbing is easier and safer but requires more preparation. Unassisted climbing may be done on the fly, because you can climb without any gear. Climbing is a Complex Action and the number of hits you get on your Acrobatics + Strength [Physical] Test determines how far you can move vertically or laterally during your climb.

**Rappelling**: Rappelling is a gear-aided descent at near free-fall speed. This technique requires an Acrobatics + Body [Physical] (2) Success Test. So long as you have the proper gear and training, you can brake at any point in the descent, slow your speed and land safely. Rappelling expends a Simple Action, during which you fall at a rate of 20 metres per Combat Turn. Rappelling characters can increase the number of metres descended during that same Combat Turn by 1 for each net hit beyond the threshold on the Rappelling Test. If you take another Simple Action in the same phase, such as firing a weapon, you get a -2 dice pool penalty to both that action and the Rappelling Test. Stopping requires another Rappelling Test with the same threshold. On an unsuccessful test, you don’t slow down and may take damage if you hit the ground at speed.

|**Climbing Table**||
| :- | :- |
|**Situation**|**Movement Distance**|
|Assisted climbing down (rappelling)|20 metres +1 metre per hit|
|Assisted climbing upward|1 metre per hit|
|Assisted climbing horizontally|1 metre per 2 hits|
|Assisted climbing upside down (on a ceiling or overhang)|1 metre per 3 hits|
|Unassisted climbing upward|1 metre per 2 hits|
|Unassisted climbing down|1 metre per hit|
|Situation|Dice Pool Modifier|
|Assisted Climbing|+2|
|*Surface is:*||
|Easily climbable (chain-link fence)|+1|

|Flat (brick wall, side of old building)|-3|
|Sheer (metal wall, seamless stone)|-5|
|Slippery or wet|-2|
|Greased or gel-treated|-4|
### **Falling**
When a character falls more than three metres, they take Physical damage with a DV equal to the number of metres fallen, with an AP of -4. Use Body + Armour to resist this damage. The DV may be modified by a soft landing surface.

Falling characters drop 50 metres in the first Combat Turn, 100 metres in the second Combat Turn, 150 metres in the third Combat Turn and 200 metres every Combat Turn after that. Terminal velocity for a falling body is about 200 metres per turn.


**<a name="_toc218024794"></a>DERIVED VALUES**\

==============================================
**Defence Test**: Reaction + Intuition.

**Block**: Add the character’s Unarmed Combat Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

**Parry**: Add the character’s Melee Weapon Skill Rating to their Defence Test. Bonus die, such as from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test.

**Dodge**: Add the character’s Acrobatics Skill Rating to their Defence Test.


**<a name="_toc218024795"></a>CONTACTS**\

========================================
You are who you know. In the shadows of the Sixth World, this is truer than you might want to believe. Contacts are NPCs who serve as sources of information, goods and services that keep shadowrunners alive and well. Often, they can’t get chip-truth about what they’ve gotten themselves into from anyone else.

- Every character receives free points to spend on their initial contacts equal to their **Charisma rating x3**.
- The cost of a contact is the sum of their Connection and Loyalty.
- A single contact may have no more than 7 points spent on them at character creation.
- There are no limits on how many contacts the character may purchase.

*You can spend karma to improve or add to your contacts. Each point of Connection or Loyalty costs 1 karma.*

There are two Ratings that measure just **how useful** a contact is: **Connection** and **Loyalty.**

**Connection**: this measures the contact’s influence. The higher the Connection Rating, the more juice the contact has. A character can start the game with contact of a **maximum Connection rating of 6**.

**Loyalty**: This shows how much you can trust the contact. The higher, the Loyalty Rating, the more the contact is willing to do for the PC. A character can start the game with contact of a **maximum Loyalty rating of 6**.

|**Connection**||
| :- | :- |
|***Rating***|*Description*|
|**1**|Virtually no social influence.|
|**2**|Has one or two friends with some Knowledge skills or some minor social influence.|
|**3**|Has a few friends, but not a lot of social influence.|
|**4**|Knows several people in a neighbourhood; a borough mayor or gang leader.|
|**5**|Knows several people and has a moderate degree of social influence; a city councilman or low-level executive in a small-to-medium corporation.|
|**6**|Known and connected across this state; a city/sprawl mayor or governor, notable fixer or mid-level executive in a medium-sized corporation.|

|**Loyalty**||
| :- | :- |
|***Rating***|*Description*|
|**1**|Just Biz: The relationship is purely mercenary, based solely on economics. The people involved may not even like each other and they won’t offer any sort of preferential treatment.|
|**2**|Regular: The relationship is still all business, but the parties treat each other with a modicum of mutual respect.|
|**3**|Acquaintance: The people in the relationship are friendly, but calling them actual friends might be stretching it. The contact is willing to be inconvenienced in small ways for the character but won’t take a fall for them.|
|**4**|Buddy: There’s actual friendship here, or at least solid mutual respect. The contact will do out of their way for the character if needed.|
|**5**|Got Your Back: The parties know and trust each other and have for some time. The contact will back the character even in risky situations.|
|**6**|Friend for Life: The contact and character will go to the wall for each other, if that’s what it takes.|

### **Using Contacts**
Friday night socials and a beer at the local bar are all well and good, but the real value of a contact is what they can do for you, and while these things are helpful, they rarely come for free. There are **six major things they can do**:

**Legwork**: Legwork is chasing down the data trail and answering questions that may not be found on the Matrix.

**Networking**: Networking is all about putting the right people in the same room, getting them to talk and hopefully launching them on a mutually beneficial relationship.

**Swag**: You want something, other people have it. With any luck, your contact is one of these other people. You also might be able to sell them some goods you picked up while on the job.

**Shadow Services**: This is a special kind of favour. Contact who perform this kind of service have a job to do and they’re using their skills on your behalf for a form of payment besides the usual cash.

**Personal Favours**: This is also a special kind of favour. These contacts have power, influence or are in a position of authority. You want them to use that to bend the rules, turn a blind eye or whisper in someone’s ear a suggestion.

**Support**: These contacts may not have power, a job that can be exploited or money you can borrow, but dammit, they’ve got your back. Some may have some talent, a cool you that you don’t know how to use or maybe they just have a place for you to crash. More often, support contacts are the friends and minor contacts that are not necessarily a big part of the shadowrunner’s business but play a role in the other aspects of their life.
### **What does a Contact Want?**
Contacts don’t do things for you out of the goodness of their hearts. Everything has a price. Payment doesn’t have to come in nuyen, but it has to come. Maybe it’s favour trading, maybe it’s helping the contact satisfy a particular vice or maybe it’s supplying critical data. Each contact has a transaction type they prefer and if their price isn’t met, the character owes the contact. If the price isn’t paid in a proper time frame, the contact’s going to notice and there will be consequences.

**Cash**: For many contacts, the almighty digital nuyen is acceptable, especially in transactions for services and goods. A service fee would of course be added to the price of the item or service depending on the relationship the contact has with the character and the effort to find the item.

**Services**: More often contacts will offer their support, service or intel for a character provided that the character in turn does a job for them. The services a contact may request can be grouped into the following categories: shadow work, contact-related work and drek jobs.

**Barter**: There are contacts who do not use a bank or nuyen to keep their electronic footprint at a minimum, so they favour trading for goods, keeping everything off-bank and off-book.

**<a name="_toc218024796"></a>NUYEN**\

=====================================
- - Karma can be converted to nuyen at a rate of **2,000 nuyen per Karma point.** 
- - A maximum of 235 Karma can be spent this way. 
- - The character needs to spend the vast majority of nuyen they have. 
- - By the end of character creation, they may choose to hold onto no more than 5,000 nuyen as starting funds. 
- - Starting funds may be allocated to an online banking account linked to a SIN or on certified credsticks (see Equipment below).


**<a name="_toc218024797"></a>LIFESTYLE**\

=========================================
Some shadowrunners are in the business to right wrongs or to get revenge. There are a few in the business because they are utter psychopaths. For the rest, though, shadowrunning is mainly a matter of survival. They’re not willing to sell their souls to the corps and they know that begging will get them nowhere. So they scrape up money any way they can so that they can pay for the basics of life – food, shelter and maybe a little fun from time to time.

A character’s lifestyle represents the money they have to spend to live in the way they have selected. This can range from the homeless life of someone scraping up whatever food and temporary shelter they can get their hands on to those who live the lords of the sprawl, dwelling in walled-off palaces or airy condominiums that flaunt the extravagance the owner has earned. Most shadowrunners, of course, are far closer to the former than the later.

At the end of the night, every runner has to have a place to come home to. That place where they hang up their SMG, spells, deck or drone. A character must select one of the lifestyles below to be their primary Lifestyle – this represents the general affluence of their day-to-day life. They may elect to pay other lifestyle costs as well to represent maintaining separate residences for alternate identity or “safehouse” purposes but must pay full cost on all lifestyles they maintain.
### **Luxury**
**Cost**: 100,000¥ per month and up!

This lifestyle offers the best of everything: ritzy digs, lots of high-tech toys, the best food and drink, you name it. The character has a household staff, maid service or sophisticated drones to do the chores. They get by in their massive mansion, snazzy condo or the penthouse suite in a top hotel. Home security is top-of-the-line, with well-trained guards, astral security and quick response times. Their home entertainment system is better than that in public theatres and accessible from anywhere in the home. They’re on the VIP list at several exclusive restaurants and clubs, both real and virtual. This is the life for the high-stakes winners in the world of Shadowrun: high-level executives, government big shots, Yakuza bigwigs and the few shadowrunners who pull of the big scores (and live to spend their pay).
### **High**
**Cost**: 10,000¥ per month

A High lifestyle offers a roomy house or condo, good food and the technology that makes life easy. The character may not have the same perks as the really big boys, but neither do they have as many people gunning for them. Their home is in a secure zone or protected by good, solid bribes to the local police contractor and gang boss. They have a housekeeping service or enough tech to take care of most chores. This is the life for the well-to-do on either side of the law: mid-level managers, senior Mob bosses and the like.
### **Middle**
**Cost**: 5,000¥ per month

The Middle lifestyle offers a nice house or condo with lots of comforts. Character with this lifestyle sometimes eat nutrisoy as well as higher-priced natural food, but at least the autocook has a full suite of flavour faucets. This is the lifestyle of ordinary wage-earners or reasonably successful criminals.
### **Low**
**Cost**: 2,000¥ per month

With this lifestyle, the character has an apartment and nobody is likely to bother them much as long as they keep the door bolted. They can count on regular meals; the nutrisoy may not taste great, but at least it’s hot. Power and water and available during assigned rationing periods. Security depends on how regular the payments to the local street gangs are. Factory workers, petty crooks and other folks stuck in a rut, just starting out or down on their luck tend to have Low lifestyles.
### **Squatter**
**Cost**: 500¥ per month

Life stinks for the squatter and most of the time so does the character. They eat low-grade nutrisoy and yeast, adding flavours with an eyedropper. Their home is a squatted building, perhaps fixed up a bit, possibly even converted into barracks or divided into closet-sized rooms and shared with other squatters. Or maybe they just rent a coffin-sized sleep tank by the night. The only thing worse than the Squatter lifestyle is living on the streets.
### **Streets**
**Cost**: Hey pal, life ain’t all bad. It’s free.

The character lives on the streets – or in the sewers, steam tunnels, condemned buildings or whatever temporary flop they can get. Food is wherever the character finds it, bathing is a thing of the past and the character’s only security is what they create for themselves. This lifestyle is the bottom of the ladder, inhabited by down-and-outers of all stripes.
### **Sample Locations**
#### **High: Bonaparte’s Beachfront Condos	Cost: 10,000¥ per month**
Beachfront, overlooking the ocean with quality every step of the way. You have all the furniture and accessories you want, including the matching curtains. Your furniture is higher end and well-made. You have real art in your home, plus as much virtual art and décor as you want. You household drones are efficient and well-maintained. You eat on real china plates and drink from crystal wine glasses.

*Comforts & Necessities [5]*

Your home is beyond cozy, with enough space for guests or entertaining visitors at home. All your basic needs have been met and you are working on indulgences. Only exceptional situations interrupt your utilities.

You have state-of-the-art entertainment technology in your home and you have access to commercial-free or exclusive online entertainment. You don’t have to worry about budgeting for date night and can have a few standing reservations to exclusive restaurants or clubs. Your entertainment access and tech is enough to make your friends envious and impress your dates. Vacations last longer or occur more frequently.

*Security [4]*

Your home has excellent security, which deters all but the most determined and well-equipped thieves. You have a private security contract with a reputable firm and drones and trained metahumans patrol your property at all times. Your windows and doors have superior locks. Your Matrix system is well protected too, with IC running at all times. Your neighbours are likely to call police if they notice anything suspicious and the neighbours’ security teams will likely come as backup for your own if there are any problems. You enjoy considerable safety and privacy in your home.

*Neighbourhood [5]*

Revere (Rating A: 2D6 +3 minutes Response Time)

This suburb features high-class residences and corporate buildings. Police drones patrol the streets, scanning everyone for their ID and SINs, as well as contraband, and metahuman officers are quick to respond to issues. Neighbourhood watches will report anyone who doesn’t fit in with the right “look” to the police.

*Zen Den* (Asset)

Everyone has to have a place to show off their cool stuff, a place where they are surrounded by things that are fun and comfortable. The zen den is a room dedicated to the hobbies of the character. If could be a physical collection of vintage bottles, a trideo set linked to megapulses worth of trid movies, an immersive sports-viewing room and what-have-you.
#### **Middle: Troy Boston Apartments	Cost: 5,000¥ per month**
This 19 story high rise was once touted as a luxury apartment building but time and lack of maintenance have taken their toll. While still a very nice place to live, the building shows signs of its age and the year of wear and tear on the faux-hardwood floors, stone countertops and stainless steel appliances show in the scrapes, dents and dings. While the building contains almost four hundred apartments, they are all either studio, one bedroom or two bedroom at the largest.

*Comforts & Necessities [3+]*

Your apartment is comfortable and cozy with a full bedroom set and matching living room set. There is an AR window that allows you to change your view to one of a decent range of subscriptions. You have stable utilities, although the occasional peak-usage brownout still occurs. It comes with included parking in any space in the adjacent carpark stack, which is usually not filled to capacity. The apartment has a SOTA set of kitchen devices. Soy, krill and mycoprotein are architecturally “printed” into something that looks and tastes like close to the real thing. You can afford bottled water, you have centrally controlled appliances that work, such as a laundry machine and dishwasher, and you have mid-priced new clothing or items you bought on sale from Mortimer of London or Vashon Island. You can afford subscriptions to multiple entertainment sites. Nights on the town are more frequent and you can go to the occasional large event as well as an annual vacation.

*Security [3]*

Your apartment building’s security keeps out unwanted visitors and casual thieves. Determined thieves will have to work to get access to your place. Locks and in-home security are above average (Rating 3). Your neighbours are likely to notice any suspicious characters or loud noises and call security. Smoke detectors and fire suppression systems are standard in all apartments and homes at this level. Your Matrix system has an average firewall and will at least monitor itself for intrusions. There is a Panicbutton in the home connected to contracted police so you can feel safe and secure in your home.

*Neighbourhood [3]*

South Boston (Rating C: 1d6 x5 minutes Response Time)

South Boston is a pleasant, well-kept community. The public utilities, such as electricity and water, are reliable, the wireless coverage is up 24/7 and the neighbourhood has a standing contract with Lone Star. Police drones patrol the streets and you can go out at night without body armour. There are several popular chain restaurants to choose from, the grocery delivery serves are well-stocked and there might even be a park or green space. Neighbourhood watches are common and street crime is not. On the downside, this district requires all metahumans to enable public view of their SIN at all times.
#### **Middle: Atlas Arms 		Cost: 10,000¥ per month (this includes the Troll racial increase to Lifestyle costs)**
The Atlas Arms is an oddity: a classy establishment is a nice area, designed and constructed specifically to accommodate trolls. But not, just any trolls. It is marketed specifically to corporate bodyguards – the kind who wear suits and mirrorshades. While expensive, the comfort of having wide hallways, doors you don’t need to stoop under and furniture that doesn’t creak and feel like it’s about to break when you sit on it is considered by many to be worth it. In keeping with its target clientele, it also boasts a high quality gym with troll-sized (and reinforced) equipment as well as a boxing ring and sparring centre.

*Comforts & Necessities [3]*

Your rooms at the Atlas Arms have comfortable furniture, specifically designed for trolls. The walls are fully covered with wallpaper and include AR windows and wallspace programs and subscriptions. A BusyBuddy cleaning drone keeps things clean and your CHN (Central Home Node) is secure. It comes with a designated parking space in an underground garage. Soy is prepared on a multi-function soy processor and is almost indistinguishable from the real thing and you can occasionally splurge on real food like coffee on Sundays. You can afford bottled water, you have centrally controlled appliances that work, such as a laundry machine and dishwasher, and you have mid-priced new clothing or items you bought on sale from Mortimer of London or Vashon Island.

*Security [4]*

The Atlas Arms security is excellent, which deters all but the most determined and well-equipped thieves, including a round-the-clock manned security system. Your doors (front and balcony) have superior maglocks (Rating 4) and reinforced frames. The building’s security team will likely come as backup if there are any problems. You enjoy considerable safety and privacy in the Atlas Arms.

*Neighbourhood [3]*

Mattapan (Rating C: 1d6 x5 minutes Response Time)

Mattapan is a pleasant, well-kept community. The public utilities, such as electricity and water, are reliable, the wireless coverage is up 24/7 and the neighbourhood has a standing contract with Lone Star. Police drones patrol the streets and you can go out at night without body armour. There are several popular chain restaurants to choose from, the grocery delivery serves are well-stocked and there might even be a park or green space. Neighbourhood watches are common and street crime is not. On the downside, this district requires all metahumans to enable public view of their SIN at all times.

*Entertainment - Gym* (Asset)

Weights, treadmill, elliptical quadrilateral, gradient tricycle or whatever device is trending. All training devices and the space around them are troll-sized.
#### **Low: Grey Gables		Cost: 2,000¥ per month**
A squat, grey building that has seen better days but is holding on amid the urban decay. Conveniently, it is located at a hub of city rail, bus lines and the subway allowing for easy transport throughout the city.

*At the beginning of sessions that start after resting in this location, you must roll to resist 2S damage from the fatigue of this lifestyle.*

*Comforts & Necessities [2]*

You can count on regular meals; the nutrisoy may not taste great, but at least it’s hot. Power and water and available during assigned rationing periods. You own some cheap furniture purchased at a mass-market retailer. Still, your chairs match and you have somewhere to sit while enjoying your AR. You have a limited subscription to a virtual wall space program to decorate the apartment. There’s an open parking lot out the back where you can almost always find a space to park. Wireless coverage is available but at a low signal rating. You wear clothes from a second hand store or the sales rack at Kong Wal-Mart and you do your laundry at a cred-op facility.

*Security [2]*

With a maglock that deters crimes of opportunity and a bolt you can slide across your door, you can sleep (relatively) safely at night. The local street gang is in charge of building security and about as effective as their last payoff.

*Neighbourhood [2]*

Brookline (Rating D: 1d6 x12 minutes Response Time)

The neighbourhood has some community to it. Most people live in apartments or multi-family housing and even pay rent. This is a typical part of the sprawl, with dilapidated buildings, petty crime and little maintenance or public services. You can walk the streets during the day without being mugged and a sturdy lock should keep your things safe.
#### **Squatter: Pod Palace 		Cost: 500¥ per month**
Anything but a palace, this coffin hotel is cheap, basic and better than sleeping on the street.

*At the beginning of sessions that start after resting in this location, you must roll to resist 4S damage from the fatigue of this lifestyle.*

*Comforts & Necessities [1]*

Sure, the only space you can really call your own is a tube slightly longer and wider than you are, but it’s padded, dry and you can lock it against intruders. Plus, vending machines and shared bathroom facilities (with shutoff timers and no hot water) are available nearby. It’s not luxurious, but it has the basic amenities you need to live, and occasionally they’re even clean. Mostly of you clothing is Vendingwear (recycled plastic shredded and woven into fabric either avocado green or dirt brown in colour). But you do have one good set of second-hand clothes. You have enough food to eat at least one solid meal a day, but it’s unprocessed, unflavoured soy and you drink rainwater or second-hand bottled water with it.

*Security [1]*

The cheap lock is better than nothing and at least there are several hundred pods in the building so it would be hard to find you amongst the rest.

*Neighbourhood [2]*

Medford (Rating D: 1d6 x12 minutes Response Time)

Adjacent to the highway, industrial zone and wildlands that overtook the ruins of entire city blocks, the neighbourhood is one that police patrols only come through when it’s inconvenient to go around. The air pollution is high, water quality low and a day where there isn’t a brownout or blackout it rare.

**<a name="_toc218024798"></a>MAGIC**\

=====================================
### **Force**
Almost everything magical has an attributer known as Force, including spirits, spells, foci and more. This attribute is a measure of magical power of the object or being. Force is often used as a limit for magical effects performed without the channelling benefits of reagents or foci.
### **Drain**
Drain is the price you pay for wielding awesome magical power. The manipulation of mana, whether forming of a spell, brewing a potion or bringing forth a being from another plane, can exhaust of injure you. Mana is a form of energy and channelling greater quantities of that energy can strain the body and mind. This effect is referred to as Drain. Magical actions that cause Drain have a Drain Value, which is a measure of how much Drain they inflict.

Drain generally is inflicted on your as Stun damage, though there are situations in which it can be Physical damage. You resist the damage from Drain through a Drain Resistance Test; each hit reduces the Drain by one. Any remaining Drain is applied as boxes of damage to your Stun (or Physical) Condition Monitor. Drain damage, regardless of whether it is Stun or Physical damage, cannot be healed by any means other than the natural properties of the body – that means no magical healing and no medkits. If you overdo it, you’ll simply need to make time for some rest.

**<a name="_toc218024799"></a>TRADITIONS**\

==========================================
A magical tradition describes how you interact with mana. Sure, you don’t necessarily need things like chants, elegant hand gestures, muttered curses and a holistic philosophy to sling spells and summon spirits but it sure helps you connect to the magic, and your tradition gives you exactly that. Often, when looking for ways to focus, people fall back on elements of their culture or background that they associate with magic. If you spend your whole life thinking that magic happens when you wave a small wand, having such a wand in your hand helps you focus your abilities. Or maybe you’ve been told that magic can be contained in a beaded necklace – in that case, holding and fingering such a necklace is precisely what you need. All magicians are members of one of the magical traditions.

### **Hermetic Mage**
The hermetic mage relies on logic, practice and execution of a planned formula rather than intuition and improvisation to effectively cast spells. They have learned to control magic and believe that the universe (both the magical parts and the mundane) follows patterns of energy that can be manipulated through complex symbols, formulae and arcane knowledge of its components. This tradition was widely practiced (if not effective) even before the Awakening and this form appealed early on to corporations and governments due to its intellectual, formalised nature. In hermetic thinking, casting magic involves imposing the magician’s will on the universe – so you can imagine some of the egos that emerge when mages get together. Mages are scholars and often have libraries of magical information from which they design spells. Any mage worth their reagents has a least a digital copy of one of the founding texts on hermeticism (rich mages have a fancy hard copy written and bound by hand in a very fancy ceremony). Hermetic trappings also include deluxe, well-crafted equipment in archaic laboratories where mages can create preparations and carry out their research. Mages create circles of power (they’re really just magical lodges, just with a hermetic twist, but don’t try to tell a mage that).

Mages, unsurprisingly, take a somewhat arrogant view on conjuring. The mage tends to believe that spirits are intelligent but inferior beings predestined for servitude. With that mindset, mages tend to be more comfortable binding spirits than are spellcasters of other traditions.
### **Shaman**
The shaman uses mana to balance the world of nature and their own will. They believe in harmony and guidance, observing the world and using emotion to weave magic. They respect the gift of magic that connects them to the flow of the spirit of life. To the shaman, the earth is a living being and her children are spirits who guide and aid those that support her; spirits of the sky, mountain, birds, rates, even metahumanity. Shamanis, has been practiced far longer than hermetic magic and can be found in all parts of the world, although it wasn’t taken seriously by modern metahumanity until the Great Ghost Dance. To the shaman, casting a spell is asking a greater universal entity, such as a totem spirit, to grant their power. Shamans call their magical lodges “medicine lodges”. A medicine lodge (also known as a sweat lodge, inipi, kiva, temazcal or a number of other names) can take a variety of forms, including a small domed hit with an animal skin roof or a hole dug into the ground and carefully covered with a ceiling of woven branches or in an urban area, a small room filled with skins, painting and artistically decorative urban junk.

The shamanic perspective on conjuring is based on a belief that spirits are intelligent and ancient, and they should be treated with the respect one would show an elder. Due to their belief that spirits are everywhere, shamans frequently summon spirits from the area when the need arises, rather than binding spirits for long periods. Shamans often develop personal connections to spirits, following them as they learn magic.
### **The Buddhist Tradition**
For Buddhists in the Sixth World, magic springs from personal self-development and spiritual enlightenment. The Buddhist magical tradition mainly stems from one sect of Buddhism – Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism, generally – as the other sects do no teach specific techniques related to sorcery and summoning and instead see magic as another part of reality that must be overcome to find enlightenment (Nirvana). Many magicians who follow the Wuxing or Shinto tradition also consider themselves followers of Buddhism. Buddhists can be called yogis (or yoginis), though this is a general term for practitioners of Southeast Asian religions including Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Traditionalists prefer the term Bodhisattva.

The teachings of Buddhism, common to all Buddhists, include the “four noble truths”: 1) existence is suffering (dukhka); 2) the causes of suffering are craving and attachment (trishna); 3)the end of suffering can be found and is called Nirvana; and 4) the path to Nirvana is the eightfold path: right views, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. Buddhism teaches that reality is most correctly understood as process and relation instead of entity or substance.

The weaving of mana into spells is performed through the proper chanting of mantras and the state of mind that activity creates. The pattern of motion can be included as a way to focus. Some see if as a way of changing reality. Buddhist ritual spellcasting techniques are called mantras. It is a method of mind and body meditation incorporating qi-like channelling of mana energies.

Spirits summoned by a Buddhist are believed to be enlightened divinities that have decided to remain on earth out of compassion for those who still strive to attain Nirvana.
### **Christian Theurgy**
Christianity made its transition to the Sixth World in fits and starts. For some people, it was easy. The supernatural had always played a role in their stories and beliefs, so they simply accepted magic as part of the belief framework they’d always held. Others, however, identified magic with the witchcraft and satanism they’d been warned about for years, so they put up walls (the Catholic Church in particular erecting some strong barriers). The *Imago Dei* encyclical helped break down those walls but it also transitioned people away from the belief that magic was a manifestation of godly power. Christian Theurgists in general see magic as a tool they can use to perform God’s work, rather than a direct channel to the divine. Spirits often make Christian Theurgists uncomfortable – they’re not sure if they should treat them like the souls of the dead, angels, devils or something else, so they’re often more comfortable just leaving them alone.

In its ideal form, Christianity is about helping others and relieving their pain where possible and there are Christian Theurgists who attempt to live up to this ideal. Throughout history, however, there have been all sorts of acts done in the name of Christianity and that remains the case today. Depending on what part of Christian teachings they emphasise or how they choose to interpret them, Christian Theurgists may be involved in a wide variety of activities ranging from the charitable to the reprehensible. But whatever they do, it will have that certain tinge of a holy crusade.
### **Cosmic**
Since the first human (or metahuman, if you like) appeared, the stars have been a source of fascination and wonder. For some mages, simply pondering the heavens was not enough. For these Awakened, the cosmos is the source of life and the most powerful agent in all reality. The harmony of the celestial bodies, their perfect orbits and their predictable nature pleases Cosmic Mages and they aspire for their magic to be similarly perfect and predictable.

Cosmic Mages point to ancient worship of heavenly bodies in Babylon, Egypt and Rome as the basic for their belief, although their forebears tapped into power they didn’t understand. While Cosmic Mages are the first to admit their knowledge is limited as well, they believe that their expanded understanding of the universe and its nature gives them further insight through which to channel their magic.

The fundamental forces behind the universe, the planets, the stars and even dark matter have replaced ancient anthropomorphic symbolism, but honour the sun, moon and stars has resurged, often in corporate settings, as a non-threatening tradition for corporate mages to participate in. Cosmic magic is not idealistic, but skews more deterministic. While Cosmic Mages believe in individual will, they assert that everything happens as a result of the cause-and-effect process begun by the creation of the universe itself.

Cosmic Mages exclusively follow the Sun, Moon or Star mentor spirits (though some whisper about a Black Hole mentor spirit).

Beyond recognising the universe as the ultimate source of power, Cosmic Mages have few unchallenged ideals. They value science and exploration and have little patience for other traditions, which they consider fairy tales.
### **Druid**
The umbrella term “druid” encompasses a variety of beliefs, from the nature-centred perspective of the Celtic druids to the heavily shamanic viewpoint of wild druids to the esoteric mumblings of English druids. The commonality between the beliefs in the invocation of spirits tied to particular locations and the desire of the druid to work with those spirits to gain a measure of control over what happens in that spot. The Celtic druid may believe in a spirit that predates the existence of humanity, while English druids believe the spirits were shaped by the places and by the humans living there but in operative terms that is a minor distinction – both believe the spirit is important and both want the spirit on their side.

While druids have a great respect for the land, that attitude often is limited to their piece of land. They can be very territorial, working hard to protect their chosen lands while unleashing fury on spots they believe may be a threat to them. They are highly conscious of background counts, mana ebbs, ley lines and other astral phenomena, since they know how those elements can affect the defence of their territory. Many of them are quite proactive in aspecting the mana of their favoured area toward their tradition, giving them a very useful advantage.
### **Hinduism**
The Hindu tradition is based on the Hindu religious system and it is designed to provide a path for the enlightened to reach transcendence. The path is one of ritual devotion, asceticism and karmic purity. While the exact strictures followed by each school vary, most accept the precepts from the *Vedas*, texts originally written in Ancient India. Those followers who are Awakened believe following the precepts of their faith assist them along the path.

The Hindi believes the soul is in a constant cycle of death and rebirth, governed by a relationship with karma. Those who follow their particular school of thought (*dasarnas*) and caste’s rules are reincarnated into a higher caste, eventually reaching *moksha* or transcendence. Those who refuse to follow their destined path are reincarnated as a lesser being.

The Awakened members of the Hindu faith who follow this tradition generally fall into two categories. The *Brahmin*, members of the high caste, use magic in a priestly manner and are usually magicians or aspected magicians. The *saddhu* practices the path of the ascetic, using yogic practices to reach their ultimate goal, primarily supported by adepts and mystic adepts. The summoning of spirits largely takes the form of calling on *devas*, roughly benevolent entities, while others call on the *asuras*, entities with less obvious motivations.

The practitioners of this tradition frequently use *bhajans* (devotional songs), mantras and yoga in their spellcasting of power usage. Magic and dance are normally major components of rituals, helping the caster focus their concentration and mana. Sanskrit is also frequently used.
### **Norse**
Norse magicians believe that Old Gods once again watch over Midgard. Asatru, the old faith of the Norse, has seen a popular comeback and with it the revival of its visceral and pagan magic. Both Awakened and mundane Asatru gather for great ceremonies known as blots and sumbles. These are traditionally held on Midsummer’s or Midwinter’s Day and the spring or autumn equinoxes. Common elements of these rituals include liberal drinking and the sacrifice of a game animal for consumption (for urban Asatru practitioners, real meat sausages can be used).

Norse mages typically have individual members of the Norse pantheon as mentor spirits. Odin may be represented in a way similar to the Wise Warrior totem, Thor has similarities to Dragonslayer and Loki, of course, has much in common with the trickster totems such as Coyote and Raven. Berserkers often claim particular animal totems such as Bear.

While possibly disappointing to those who wish to pillage and plunder as part of their belief system, the Norse paradigm is much more complex than simple berserkers and warriors. Courage, truth, honour, fidelity, discipline, hospitality, industriousness, self-reliance and perseverance are their core value. While each individual values these in various amounts, the Norse tradition finds common purpose with many of the Sixth World’s current values. The trope of the noble barbarian surely exists for some, but for others, it is the ancient family- and honour-based system that fits best with them.
### **Phytomancy**
One the surface, Phytomancy (or Green Magic) seems to have much in common with eco-shamanism or nature-based Druidic traditions. But dig a little deeper and, common interests aside, they are startlingly different. Phytomancers view their magic as coming from an elemental power beyond our world that connects all plant life together in one metaplanar ecosystem. They don’t necessarily focus on balance and harmony with nature or honouring all spirits equally. Rather, they give primacy to plant life and only pursue goals that aim to increase the growth and spread of plant life. In return, the Phytomancers gain tremendous power in the domain of plants.

Phytomancers hold respect for plant life above everything else. In their mind, life on Earth and everywhere else in the universe, not only started with plant life but is sustained by it. The idea that metahumanity, animal life in general or any other sapient life holds more value than the world’s plant life is abhorrent to them. As long as the Green survives, the rest of life will find a way also.
### **Shinto**
The official religion of Japan, Shinto has spread with the power of Imperial Japan and the corporations that originated there. Shinto features a number of public shrines devoted to the *kami* or gods. Its tenets are largely based around harmony with *kami* spirits, with Awakened activities being considered a natural extension of this concept and it lacks dogmatic approach to its worship. The religion currently has 115,000 shrines and over 25,000 priests in Japan, with more around the world. The Emperor has increased the influence of the religion in national politics by including practitioners as part of the national rebuilding effort.

Shinto is one of the few shamanic traditions accepted into the ranks of the corporations, largely as many executives are immersed in aspects of the religious beliefs from a young age and do not find its practitioners too rebellious. Unlike, Amerindian traditions, most *kannushi* do not have a single mentor but attempt to live harmoniously with all the *kami*. Key portions of this harmony are respect for nature and ensuring physical and spiritual cleanliness through proper ritual. Honouring the *kami* is important to the Awakened, as they regularly ask favours of the spirits, especially looking for assistance in the use of magic.

Shinto magic techniques are closely tied to the religion whose name they share. Protective charms, normally called *ofuda* are used to anchor wards within a building, normally placed within the home’s *kamidana* or household altar. Personal protection amulets, called *omamori*, are frequently used to ward off bad luck or to encourage success in different endeavours; for the Awakened they are commonly made into foci for Counterspelling or Banishing. Other protective charms are also used by believers to bring good fortune, fight against bad luck or induce and bless child birth.
### **Sioux**
Perhaps the most important thing to understand about beliefs in the Sioux tradition is the term Wakan Tanka. By most interpretations it means “Great Spirit”, meaning the power of life that animates everything in this world, from the sun to the earth to the plants and animals that live on it. Wakan Tanka has been described as a sheltering tree covering all the children of the one mother and one father.

But there is also an interpretation of Wakan Tanka that makes it to mean “Great Mystery”. This serves as a reminder that the power that animates the world is not something mere humans understand and that we should accept it in its mystery rather than trying to impose human understanding on it. Living with this incomprehensibility is part of life and the sooner one can accommodate oneself to it, the sooner you can be more in harmony with the world and nature instead of living in conflict.

Don’t let this goal of peace fool you into thinking that everything about the Sioux tradition is sweetness and light. Sioux mythology is full of a vast range of characters. Iktomi the spider and Coyote are always around to cause trouble, Unktehi the serpent makes trouble for Thunderbird and Double Face preys on humanity. The Great Spirit may be incomprehensible but the trouble these other beings can cause is only too plain and practitioners of the Sioux tradition are well aware of what they need to look out for. Or, if they are of a more mischievous frame of mind, who to emulate.

Rather than study formulae or ancient tomes, practitioners of the Sioux tradition try to take clues and hints from how to best do magic from the world around them. The world is full of information to those who take the time to observe it and Sioux Awakened are usually willing to take that time. They observe carefully, letting the auras and beings around them speak, doing their best to hear the stories they are telling rather than impose their own meaning upon them. Once they have that information, though, they are swift and sure – and devastating, if they need to be.
### **Wicca**
The Wiccan tradition is the Awakened manifestation of one of the Sixth World’s largest recognisable neo-pagan movements. Wicca is a collection of beliefs, tenets gathered from nineteenth century sources and New Age reasoning merged with earlier, pre-Christian concepts. The central tenets of the religion are harmony with nature and the Wiccan Rede or a similar code.

All Wiccan magicians who summon a spirit show deference and normally make a small payment of some kind, as the *Law of Threefold Return* is a constant theme in the tradition’s teachings.

Wiccan followers are not part of a monolithic entity but are composed of several different sects of lineages, sometimes called *traditions*.


**<a name="_toc218024800"></a>THE ASTRAL**\

==========================================
### **Astral Signature**
Generally, when magicians cast a spell or perform a ritual, they leave their astral fingerprints on it. This is called an **astral signature** and it’s produced on anything affected by magic skills or abilities. This astral signature can be detected by anyone with the Assensing skill. A signature lasts for a number of hours equal to the magical effect’s Force after the effect (spell, critter power, astral battle or whatever it was) ends, slowly fading into the background. An astral signature of a spell can be detected both where it was cast and where it took effect. Semi-permanent objects such as alchemical preparations and watchers contain an astral signature while they last. More permanent items such as foci, lodges and magic circles always contain the astral signature of the owner.

A character can attempt to read an astral signature when an Assensing + Intuition [Astral] Test. This is not the simplest task, as perceiving the understanding an astral signature is somewhat difficult amid the mixture of magic and emotional background of the astral plane. Once successfully read, a signature can be recognised again (possibly with a Memory Test). Other details such as the general class of spell or spirit or the skill of the magician can be determined with net hits (similar to Assensing an aura).

A magician using astral perception can “wipe clean” a temporary astral signature (such as from sorcery) or hasten its normal fading. A magician can spend a Complex Action to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signature to fade by 1 hour (mentally pushing the signature into the background energy, if you will). No test is required. This action can be done multiple times until the astral signature is gone. If the signature is not completely erased, it will be obvious to other assensing it that someone tampered with it.
### **Astral Tracking**
Nearly all magical things (spirits, spells, foci and magical lodges) have an astral link to whoever was responsible for them. Active spells are linked to their casters, spirits are linked to their summoners, astrally projecting magicians are linked to their physical bodies and foci and magical lodges are linked to the magicians who activated them. Awakened entities who assense the astral signature of these astral forms can track their links through the astral plane back to their sources. Following an astral link requires an Assensing + Intuition (5, 1 hour) [Astral] Extended Test modified by Astral Tracking Modifiers.

**<a name="_toc218024801"></a>ASTRAL PERCEPTION**\

=================================================
Many Awakened characters can perceive the astral plane from the physical world. This ability is called **astral perception**. It is a primary sense used in the astral plane that allows you to “see” auras and other things in the astral world overlaid on the material plane. Technically, astral perception isn’t vision – you don’t need working eyes to see in the astral plane – but vision is the easiest metaphor to use.

With the skill of Assensing, you can interpret the “colours” and “brightness” of an aura to determine the wellness and state of being of the subject. When astrally perceiving, you become **dual-natured** (meaning you have presence in both the physical and astral planes simultaneously) and can interact with astral objects, including through combat. Astrally perceiving while trying to accomplish mundane tasks is very distracting; you take a -2 dice pool penalty to actions on the physical plane.

While astral perception allows an Awakened character to sense the astral plane, actually interpreting what you’re looking at takes practice. Interpreting auras to gain information about the person or thing to which they belong is called Assensing. If you want to learn more about an aura, you may make a Simple Assensing + Intuition [Astral] Test, with the number of hits determining how much you learn. Without attempting to read an aura, you can still get an impression of what type of aura it is (spell, ritual, spirit, living creature, foreboding horror from beyond all mortal ken, etc.).

Like physical perception, you don’t need to make a test to see things that are immediately obvious (and since astral forms are bright and vibrant, this means that most astral forms are easy to spot). You only need to roll the dice when your target is trying to hide or when you’re trying to observe in detail – then you make an Assensing Test to see what you can see.

Objects that are neither magical nor living do not have an aura; they are featureless grey shadows of their physical form. They can, however, pick up impressions for a limited time from being in contact with living auras. A teddy bear in the Barrens might pick up a child’s fear, a wedding ring its owner’s sense of love and joy or a murder weapon an aura of rage. These impressions are vague and fleeting, but you don’t need to assense the object to get them.


**<a name="_toc218024802"></a>ASTRAL PROJECTION**\

=================================================
If astral perception is like sticking your face in a lake to peer below the surface, astral projection is diving right in. Your consciousness is contained in an astral form and can leave your corporeal body. Your astral form is a mental projection of your self-image combined with physical characteristics based on your mental attributes, which means you can always have awesome hair.

A projecting mage can travel around the astral plane at great speeds unimpeded by material objects such as walls, floors and burly goons (unless they are dual-natured). Your body is in a coma-like state while your astral body is out in the aether. Your mind and body are still connected, so any damage taken to body or mind is felt by both. Only characters who are full Magicians can astrally project.

You’re using astral perception the entire time you’re projecting, so you can see the auras of living things. Auras alone don’t give you the mystic link you need to target spells. As the saying goes, what’s cast in astral space stays in astral space, and ditto for physical space.

### **Inherent Limit: Astral**
If you’re going to go messing about in astral space, you need a strong mind, because that’s what’s going to be doing all your heavy lifting once you leave your body behind. Your mind is both your best muscle and your basic limiter in the astral. Your Astral limit is equal to your Mental or Social limit, whichever is greater.
### **Astral Movement**
Astral forms can move almost at the speed of thought. The magician only needs to visualise themselves at a place and their astral body travels there. Any nearby places can be reached in seconds, minutes for locations on the same continent, hours to get anywhere on the globe. At this speed however, you have no time to perceive the environment and things you pass are a blur (think warp speed in movies). **Astral barriers** block astral travel and you might run into one before you realise that it’s in your way.

If you’re looking for a particular place or thing, you must travel at a slower pace. “Slower” in this case means up to 100 metres each Combat turn – this is considered to be the Walking rate in astral space. Moving faster, 5 kilometres per Combat Turn, is your Running rate – the normal penalties to actions for Running apply in these cases.

Astral forms can move in any direction – they are not limited by gravity as they are in the physical world, though most projecting magicians tend to stick close to the ground because that’s where most of the interesting stuff is, if not out of force of habit. The exception to this freedom of movement is at the limits of the Earthly atmosphere (about eighty kilometres up) – the Gaiasphere weakens to the point where astral voyagers usually go mad or die.

Only astral forms can slow or affect another astral form. The Earth is solid on the astral plane, just as it is in the physical world; astral forms cannot pass through it. Secure facilities are often built underground to keep out astral intruders. Active weapon foci have a presence in astral space and can harm an astral form but you must be present on the astral plane to use the focus in astral combat. Only mana spells affect astral forms.
### **Manifesting**
A purely astral form such as a spirit or an astrally projecting magician can interact with the physical plane by manifesting. Manifesting is a psychic effect that lets you make yourself visible and audible on the physical plane through an act of will. Manifesting makes a Complex Action to engage or disengage. You appear on the physical plane as a ghostly, hazy image of your astral form and may freely communicate with physical characters. Unlike the Materialisation power of spirits, manifesting doesn’t give you a physical form, so you can’t interact with anything physically (or be harmed by physical attacks). It’s a psychic connection, so you can’t cast spells on targets on the physical plane while you’re manifesting. For the same reason, technological devices can’t detect or record you. You’re still on the astral plane, so astral attacks can still target you. Manifesting is pretty taxing, so you can only manifest for a total of your Magic rating x 5 minutes per astral projection session.
### **Staying Astral**
It’s mentally taxing to stay on the astral plane for a long time. You can use astral projection for a number of hours equal to your Magic Rating x 2. If you stay out longer, your astral being ceases to exist and your body dies. If you return to your body, this clock stops, but it doesn’t reset until you’ve spent at least as long in your body as you spent out of it.
### **Astral Detection**
Physical beings may sense when an astral form passes through their aura. Make a Perception + Intuition (4) [Mental] Test – you receive a +2 dice pool bonus if you’re Awakened. If the test is successful, the character feels slightly breathless and experiences a chill or tingling sensation from the passing of the astral form. Some security personnel are trained to recognise this feeling as a sign of an astral intruder. This specialisation of Perception is called Numinous Perception, which includes both the chilly tingle of astral forms and the “vibes” of noticing magic.
### **Astral Combat**
Astral combat is resolved in a similar way to physical combat. Astrally perceiving and dual-natured character use their physical attributes and skills fight opponents with a physical body and their Astral Combat + Willpower to fight wholly astral entities. Astrally projecting characters use their mental attributes in place of physical ones along with the Astral Combat skill. There are no ranged weapons that function in astral space, so unarmed attacks, active weapon foci and mana spells are the only options for astral combat.

Unarmed astral attacks are performed through an Opposed Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral] v Intuition + Logic Test. Astral attacks with a weapon focus are an Opposed Astral Combat + Willpower [Astral] v Intuition + Logic Test. The Base Damage Value for Magicians is their Charisma; for a Weapon Focus, the weapon damage; for a spirit, the spirit’s Force and for a Watcher, 1. Add 1 to the DV per net hit on an attack. Damage inflicted from astral combat can be either Stun or Physical (attacker’s choice). Astral barriers can only be affected by Physical damage.
### **Mana Barriers**
Mana barriers are magical walls that impede or block magic and astral forms. Mana barrier can be on the physical or astral planes, but some are dual-natured barriers that exist on both.

Mana barriers on the physical plane are invisible (except to astral perception), but they act as solid barriers to spells, manifesting entities, spirits and active foci. Anybody trying to cast a spell through a barrier must contend with the Force of the barrier, which is added to the Defence or the Resistance dice pool. If the spell doesn’t normally have an opposed dice pool, the Spellcasting test becomes an Opposed Test against the Force of the barrier.

Mana barriers on the astral plant are solid, hazily opaque walls. Such barriers stop astral movement and impose a visual penalty equal to the barrier’s Force. Astral mana barriers are resistant to astral spells as well as other astral forms, in the same manner as physical mana barriers.

Dual-natured mana barriers are active on both planes simultaneously and they act like mana barriers on both planes at once.

Adept power and many always-on critter powers are innate and so are unaffected by a barrier. Certain ranged and sustained critter powers suffer the same fate as spells.

Mana barriers do not affect their creators, who can see through them or pass through them at will and allow others to do so as well.
### **Getting Around Mana Barriers**
If you’ve got a mana barrier in your way, you’ve got a couple of options other than “give up”. You can try breaking through violently or you can try passing through subtly.

If you want to break through a mana barrier, you need to deal with its Armour and Structure Ratings, just as you would with any other barrier. A mana barrier has Armour and Structure Ratings equal to its Force. Break it quickly, because they regain their full Structure at the end of every Combat Turn. The creator of a mana barrier is instantly aware of any attack on the barrier.

Alternatively, you can slide through a barrier with Magic + Charisma [Astral] v barrier’s Force x 2 Opposed Test. If you get any net hits, you pass through the barrier and emerge on the other side. You can bring a number of friends, spirits, active foci, sustained spells or other astral forms with you – one for each additional net hit you score. If the barrier scores more hits, you fail to break through.
### **Astral Intersections**
Mana barriers and astral forms are often tied to physical objects. Astral beings can’t push physical objects around, so objects may get dragged into contact with barriers or (rarely) other astral constructs.

If this happens, each astral form makes an Opposed Test: living beings a Magic + Charisma and non-living barriers and objects a Force x 2 Test. The participant with any net hits remains normal and intact, while all others are disrupted – on a tie, all participants are disrupted.

Disruption means different consequences for different things. Disrupted spells and rituals end, disrupted preparations lose their spell and becomes mundane, disrupted mana barriers collapse, disrupted foci deactivate, disrupted spirits are banished and disrupted living creatures are knocked unconscious with a full Stun Condition Monitor. Any permanent mana barrier that is disrupted regains all its Structure at the end of the Combat Turn.


**<a name="_toc218024803"></a>ADEPTS**\

======================================
In the small segment of the world that has Awakened to magic power, there is an even smaller segment who are able to channel the mana into themselves, giving them enhanced physical abilities that make them more than meta-human. They are the physical adepts – or, for those who like fewer words, just adepts – and they are known for their very disciplined self-improvement. They include athletes, martial artists, religious acolyte, exercise gurus and others who seek to combine mind and body. Adepts are concerned with the harmony of body and mind and the strengthening of both and they focus their magical power towards those ends.

In the early days of the Sixth World, when the world saw the rise of people who could use magic to increase their own physical and mental potential, adepts didn’t face the same prejudice as magicians and shamans. Instead, they found themselves facing a mythos generated by corporate trids extolling their magical athleticism. This put adepts up on a pedestal – people either wanted to try to fight them to gain rep or to worship them, thinking that perhaps that would be the path to getting some abilities for themselves.
### **Using Powers**
As an adept, you get Power Points equal to your Magic Rating at character creation. You then spend the Power Points on buying adept powers. The maximum number of levels you can have of any one power is equal to your Magic Rating or up to the limit listed by the power, whichever is less.

Some powers are activated and some are intrinsic. Adept powers that need to be activated before they have any effect have an activation cost listed in the power’s description (usually an action of some sort). When a power doesn’t list an activation cost, their effect is intrinsic – you don’t have to take any action to gain the benefit of the power.

**Adept Drain**: Some powers cause Drain. The Drain from adept power is Stun unless specified in the description and is resisted with Body + Willpower.
### **Adept Powers**

**Adrenaline Boost**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

This power lets you accomplish more in one Combat Turn. You get +2 to your Initiative Score for the current Combat Turn for every level of this power you have. At the beginning of the next turn after the Adrenaline Boost, you take 2  Drain.

**Animal Empathy**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power gives the adept a greater affinity for all non-sentient animals, both normal and paranormal. For every level, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus to all Animal Handling Tests. This power can also be used to intimidate or frighten animals.

**Astral Perception**

|Cost: 1 pp|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- |

This power allows you to bridge the gap between the physical and astral realms and see into the astral plane. Since you’re dual-natured while you’re using astral perception, you can attack astral forms when you use this power.

**Attribute Boost**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- |

You call upon inner strength to perform amazing physical feats beyond their normal abilities. Attribute Boost must be purchases for a specific Physical Attribute (Agility, Body, Reaction or Strength); separate Attribute Boost power may be bought for different attributes. This power cannot be purchased for a Mental or Special Attribute.

When you activate this power, make a Magic + Attribute Boost Rating Test. Each hit on this test boosts your attribute rating by 1, up to your augmented Attribute maximum. This only affects your dice pools; your Physical limit and Initiative ratings don’t change with Attribute Boost. The boost lasts for a number of Combat Turns equal to twice the number of hits you get. When the boost runs out, you take Drain equal to the level of this power.

**Authoritative tone**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level (Max 3)|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Adepts with this power can speak in a way that makes people want to believe them and follow their orders. For every level of this power, an adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus to any Opposed Social Skill Test that they initiate.

**Blind Fighting**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Drawing on a special kind of sixth sense, an adept with this power is able to continue fighting even when blinded or deprived of vision. If reduces the penalty for impaired vision by one per level of this power.

**Cloak**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Using the Cloak power, the adept has an increased chance of avoiding magical detection. For every level of this power, the adept gains a +1 die for opposing a Detection spell being used against them. Cloak does not prevent the reading of the adept’s aura through astral perception or viewing from astral space; it just makes it more difficult to zero in on the targeted adept.

**Combat Sense**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Combat Sense provides an instinctive sense of any potential threats nearby. In defending against ranged and melee attacks, you gain a +1 dice pool bonus to defence tests per level of this power. Adepts with this power are always allowed a Perception Test before a possible surprise situation, gaining the benefit of being alerted if the test is successful.

**Critical Strike (Skill)**

|Cost: 0.5 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power improves a specific melee skill: either Unarmed Combat, Clubs, Blades, Astral Combat or a particular Exotic Melee Weapon skill. The specific skill is chosen when you buy the power. Increase the DV of your attacks with the selected skill by 1. Critical Strike is compatible with weapons and other adept powers. This power may be selected multiple times, each time for a different melee skill.

**Danger Sense**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You are instinctively sensitive of your surroundings and of impending threats that may not be immediately visible. It’s the bad feeling that the character gets before walking into a trap, the gut instinct that makes them jump an instant before trouble hits. For each level of this power, you get a +1 dice pool bonus on Surprise Tests.

**Empathic Healing**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

The Empathic Healing power allows an adept to literally take on the wounds of another in order to heal them. To accomplish this, the adept rolls a Magic + Willpower Test. For every hit, up to one box of Physical damage transfers from the wounded target to the adept’s Condition Monitor. Only Physical damage can be healed in this way.

Subjects with lower than normal Essence, due to augmentations or Essence loss, are more difficult to heal. Apply a negative modifier of the same amount that would be applied to healing. The transfer of wounds requires two full Combat Turns per box of damage to complete and the healing adept must maintain physical contact during the entire process. Damage modifiers are applied once the adept completes the process.

**Enhanced Accuracy (Skill)**

|Cost: 0.25 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

A weapon in your hands becomes an extension of your body. When you buy this power, choose a Combat Skill (Pistols, Clubs, Heavy Weapons, etc.). When you use the skill, add 1 to the Accuracy of the weapon you’re using. This power cannot be used with Unarmed Combat, but it can be purchased multiple times with a different skill each time.

**Enhanced Perception**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power sharpens all your senses. Add a +1 dice pool bonus per level to all Perception Tests and Assensing Tests.

**Freefall**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power helps adepts absorb the damage from a fall or jump down for a specific distance. Every level of Freefall allows the adept to fall or jump down 3 additional metres without any adverse effects (beyond the three metres normally allowed). When calculating fall damage past their personal distance threshold, subtract the overall bonus from the fall and then apply damage normally. This means that an adept with a single level in Freefall receives no damage from a fall or six metres of less, rather than the typical three metres. As long as the adept takes no damage from the fall, the fall counts as a normal Move Action and can be combined with an attack. Longer falls count as a Complex Action. This ability does not help the adept increase the distance they are jumping. 

**Improved Ability (Skill)**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power increases the Rating of a specific Combat, Physical, Social, Technical or Vehicle skill per level of the power. You need to know the skill in order to buy this power for it and you can’t but it for skill groups. The maximum improvement possible is your current skill level x 1.5 (rounded up).

**Improved Physical Attribute (Physical Attribute)**

|Cost: 1 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows you to increase a physical attribute (Body, Agility, Reaction and Strength). This augments your attribute, so your Physical limit may also increase with the new Attribute rating. This power allows you to exceed your natural Attribute maximum, up to your augmented maximum.

**Improved Potential (Limit)**

|Cost: 0.5 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows an adept to raise one of your inherent limits (Physical, Mental or Social), specified when you but the power, by 1. You may buy this power multiple times, once per inherent limit.

**Improved Reflexes**

|Cost: 1.5 pp (Level 1)|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |
|Cost: 2.5 pp (Level 2)||
|Cost: 3.5 pp (Level 3)||
This power increases the speed at which you react. For each level, you receive a +1 to Reaction (which also affects Initiative) and +1D6 Initiative Die (to a maximum of 5D6). The maximum rating of Improved Reflexes is 3 and the increase cannot be combined with other technological or magical increases to Initiative.

**Improved Sense**

|Cost: 0.25 pp each|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power gives you sensory improvements not normally possessed by your character’s metatype. These improvements may include low-light or thermographic vision, high or low frequency hearing and so on. Any sense enhancement provided by cyberware or bioware can be provided by this power, unless that either gives you bonus dice to Perception Tests or needs wireless to work (or both).

In addition to the sensory enhancements listed for cyberware and bioware, other improvements that can be selected include:

*Direction Sense*: Add a +2 dice pool bonus to Navigational skill tests when traveling. In addition, with a Perception + Intuition (2) Test, you can identify the direction you’re facing and if you’re above or below the mean sea level.

*Improved Tactile*: The adept’s fingers are sensitive to imperfections on the surface of an object, allowing you to notice something as subtle as the indentation of writing on a piece of paper (even paper on a pad beneath the sheet that was actually written on). Add a +2 dice pool bonus to tactile Perception Tests.

*Perfect Pitch*: With a Perception + Intuition (2) Test, you can recognise a musical tone either from hearing it or even feeling the vibration frequency. This doesn’t mean that you’re a good singer, just that you can recognise when you’re off key.

**Iron Will**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power makes the adept more resistant to external influences. The character may add the power’s level as a dice pool modifier in tests to resist mental manipulation or mind control, whether originating from spells, adepts powers or spirit powers.

**Killing Hands**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

This power lets you inflict lethal damage with your unarmed attacks. When inflicting damage on the target of an unarmed attack, you may choose whether to cause Stun or Physical damage. Killing hands may be combined with other adept powers that increase unarmed damage. Your Killing Hands attacks are magical, so they can bypass a creature’s magical defences against attack, such as the Immunity to Normal Weapons power and may be used by adepts with Astral Perception during astral combat.

**Kinesics**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Kinesics grants you complete control over your body’s nonverbal and subconscious communication and social cues, even when you’re in stressful social situation. It includes facial expressions, body movements, eye movements, fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure and even control over sweat glands, making it difficult to gauge your emotional state and truthfulness. Add +1 die per level to resist Social Tests and tests to read your emotions like Judge Intentions, assensing or truthfulness tests.

**Light Body**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Light Body is used to make incredible jumps over long distances. Add the power’s level to your Agility before calculating maximum distance you can jump. Also, add 1 die per level to your Acrobatics Test when you make your jump. If you fall, reduce the effective distance of a fall by the level in meters when calculating your falling damage.

**Metabolic Control**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

An adept with this power has the ability to enter a deep meditative state where all metabolic processes are slowed. This has two benefits. This first is to reduce the amount of rest the adept needs. In game terms, for every hour the adept is in this state, they increase the interval for taking fatigue damage from sleep deprivation by another three hours. The second benefit preserves the adept’s life in emergency situations. When the adept goes into Physical overflow damage, they immediately go into this meditative state. While in this state, the adept only takes an additional box of overflow damage every (Body) hours. An adept can exit this state whenever they wish, but doing so while severely injured causes all wounds or toxins to immediately take effect unless treated or healed.

**Missile Parry**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Activation: Interrupt Action|
| :- | :- |

You can catch slow-moving projectiles such as arrows, thrown knives, grenades or shuriken out of the air. This is an Interrupt Action and reduces you Initiative Score by 5. When using this power, add +1 die per level to your defence pool against the attacker’s ranged attack test. If you generate net hits, you pluck the missile out of the air. You need to have at least one empty hand to use Missile Parry. 

**Mystic Armour**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power protects you from physical attacks. For every level, this power gives you 1 point of Armour (cumulative with other armour) that also protects against damage you take in astral combat.

**Natural Immunity**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Add +1 die per level to your tests to resist toxins and disease. 

**Pain Resistance**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

Pain resistance allows you to ignore the effects of injury (but not the actual damage). For every level of pain resistance, the wound modifiers on the Condition Monitor move one box farther down the chart, so that with 1 level of this power, you take the -1 penalty after 4 boxes of damage instead of 3. If you have 2 levels of the power, the penalty doesn’t kick in until you have 5 boxes of damage. Pain resistance works equally on the Physical and Stun Condition Monitors. Pain resistance also allows you to resist pain from torture, magic, illness, etc. Each level adds a +2 dice pool bonus to any test you make to withstand suffering.

**Poison Cloud**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

This power surrounds the adept in a dense cloud of airborne toxin. All ranged attacks made while the power is active (either against or by the adept) are considered to be in Moderate Fog/Smoke. If anyone makes a successful melee attack against an adept with this power active, the attack must resist the damage effects of the poison (DV equal to the Magic attribute of the adept with the inhalation vector and an immediate onset). Otherwise, if another character is within very close range they are similarly affected. If the damage from the poison cloud is not completely resisted, the victim enters anaphylactic shock, resulting in muscle spasms and autonomic system failure if left untreated. The victim continues to take 1 box of unresisted Physical damage each Combat Turn until death or until the victim is treated as per Stabilisation.

**Poison Strike**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Prerequisite: Killing Hands|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- | :- |

Adepts with this power can channel poison into an Unarmed Combat attack to cause a poison affliction (DV equal to the Magic attribute of the adept with the contact vector and an immediate onset) in addition to the normal damage of the strike. A Simple Action is required to first channel the poison. The poison will infuse attacks for Combat Turns equal to the adept’s Magic attribute, until the adept deactivates it with a Bonus Action or is rendered unconscious.

**Rapid Healing**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You recover from damage more quickly, magically healing yourself over periods of time. Add +1 die per level to your Healing Tests. Also add +1 die per level to any tests made to heal you through magical or mundane means (such as a Heal spell or the First Aid skill), whether the attempt is made by you or another character. 

**Spell Resistance**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You are inherently resistant to spells. Add +1 die per level to Resistance Tests against spells, spell rituals, alchemical preparations or Innate Spell critter power (but not other critter powers). Spell Resistance does not interfere with spells that you choose not to resist.

**Spirit Claw**

|Cost: 0.25 pp|Activation: Bonus Action|
| :- | :- |

Spirit Claw allows the adept to temporarily create a small weapon of spiritual energy for use against spirits. Adepts have learned to form weapons based on their particular Way or paradigm – clubs, hammers, daggers, spikes and so on. Spirit Claw add (Magic x 0.5) to the adept’s unarmed DV against spirits (regardless of whether the combat is physical or astral). It remains active for (Magic x 0.5) Combat Turns or when the adept deactivates it with a Bonus Action or successfully strikes with it. To use Spirit Claw again, the energies must be re-channelled by spending another Bonus Action. Against spirits, this power can only be combined with the Killing Hands power.

**Stillness**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows an adept to exert control over their body to avoid detection. By slowing their physiological processes (heart rate, breathing and the need to flex muscles) and entering a relaxed state, the adept becomes completely motionless for a specific amount of time. Their body’s heat signature is also lessened, making the adept harder to detect by thermographic means. For every level of this power, the adept can remain in this state for approximately one hour. Anyone using auditory or thermographic means to locate or perceive an adept using this power receives a negative penalty equal to the level of the adept’s power. Visual searches or Perception Tests are unaffected by this power. This power is negated as soon as the adept moves. An adept may have a maximum of 3 levels in this power.

**Temperature Tolerance**

|Cost: 0.25 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

This power allows adepts to better withstand the effects of extreme temperatures. For every level in this power, the adept gains a +1 dice pool bonus for resisting damage caused by extreme temperature exposure. This can also be used against magical effects such as elemental fire or cold.

**Traceless Walk**

|Cost: 1 pp|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You can move over surfaces – even snow, sand or thin paper – without leaving visible traces. You make no noise through contact with the floor (though movement may still cause other sounds) and any hearing-based Perception Tests to detect you suffer a -4 dice pool penalty. You don’t trip ground-vibration or pressure sensors. You can’t walk across liquid surfaces – you’re magical, not miraculous – but you can walk across deep snow without sinking. While you can be tracked by non-visual cues such as scent, even those Track Tests are more difficult and get a -2 dice pool penalty.

**Voice Control**

|Cost: 0.5 pp per level|Intrinsic|
| :- | :- |

You get an amazing level of control over the properties of your voice. You can change your voice’s pitch, modulation and tone at will, as well as increase your volume. You can mask your voice and imitate souths within the normal range of metahuman vocalisation (no infrasound or ultrasound) and mimic the voices of others. If you use this trick to fool a person or a voice recognition system, make an Opposed Test using your Impersonation + Charisma [Mental] against the voice recognition system’s Rating x2 or against the Perception + Intuition of characters the adept is attempting to fool, adding the level of this power as a bonus to your dice pool.

You can also adjust your voice to generate positive social effects, giving you +1 per level to your Social limit.

**Wall Running**

|Cost: 0.5 pp|Activation: Simple Action|
| :- | :- |

You can run up sheer walls or other vertical surfaces a limited distance. Make a Running + Strength [Magic] Test, with hits indicating the number of meters you may climb up in an action phase. If you want to run up longer distances, you’ll need steps, ledges or somewhere you can stop and then use this power again. If you want to run across a vertical surface instead of up it, you can do so by combining this power with a Sprint action. At the end of the movement, you fall off the wall, whether you made it as far as you wanted or not.


**<a name="_toc218024804"></a>CONJURING**\

=========================================
Conjuring is the art of calling, dismissing and controlling independent astral beings called **spirits**. Conjuring can compel a spirit to come to the magician and provide services or favours with Summoning, press a spirit into lasting service with Binding or dismiss or destroy a spirit with Banishing.

**Spirit Basics**: Spirits are naturally astral forms, much like you’re naturally a physical form. A spirit exists entirely in astral space, with astral attributes based on their Force. A spirit can manifest, use astral travel and get blocked by mana barriers, just like any other astral form. Its appearance strongly reflects its type and the tradition of the magician who summoned it. A hermetic fire spirit might look like a traditional fire elemental, while a shaman’s spirit of air might appear as an eagle or a butterfly.

If a spirit wants to affect anything on the physical plane, it has to materialise first. It gets physical attributes based on its type and appears as a solid, physical version of its astral form – it’s relatively solid even if it doesn’t look solid, like a spirit whirlwind or a water elemental. The spirit is dual-natured while it’s materialised, which means it exists simultaneously on the physical and astral plane, meaning it can see objects in both places – and be targeted by both mages on the physical plane and astral entities, such as astrally projecting mages. When materialised, the spirit is able to perceive the physical world much as other material beings do. A spirit’s physical form is metahuman-sized or smaller and very obviously ethereal (there is no mistaking a spirit for something worldly). Its physical body is not subject to gravity – though most spirits stay close to the ground because that’s where all the action is – but it can be knocked around by other forces (which makes staying grounded handy at times).

Spirits follow the normal rules for combat, whether physical or astral. If all of the boxes on a spirit’s Condition Monitor (either of them) are filled, the spirit is painfully disrupted and is forced back to its home metaplane. Any services it still owes are lost.

**Spirit-Summoner Link**: A spirit doesn’t have to speak to their summoner out loud. It can communicate telepathically with the summoner, even from astral space, so it doesn’t even have to manifest to receive order or make reports. This link allows for communication over a distance but does not extend to the metaplanes, nor does it allow any other visual or audio connection. With this link, a summoner knows when a spirit they have summoned has been disrupted, as they will feel the loss of the link.

**Spirit Range**: Your spirit can’t move farther away from you than your Magic rating x 100 metres. If forced out of this range, the spirit will try to return as quickly as possible. If you send a spirit beyond this range, it counts as a remote service.
### **Summoning**
You can summon spirits of your tradition. Summoning a spirit is a Complex Action. Each summoning action can only call one spirit at a time and it only hangs around for a limited time – a summoned spirit will return to wherever it was when you called it when it’s either through with all of the services it owes you or based on your tradition (such as when the sun rises or sets). You can only have one unbound spirit at any given time.

**Choose Spirit Type & Force**: You can only choose a spirit of a type available to your tradition. You also need to choose the spirit’s Force (the higher the Force the more powerful the spirit), up to twice your Magic rating.

**Attempt Summoning**: Make an Opposed Test using Summoning + Magic [Astral] v the spirit’s Force. If you get no net hits, you have failed to summon the spirit. If you get net hits, the spirit arrives nearby in astral space, owing you one service per net hit. The nature of the services the spirit can provide depends on the type of spirit and its Force and powers.

**Resist Drain**: Whether you successfully summon the spirit or not, you must resist Drain from the attempt. The Drain Value is equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit’s defence test, with a minimum Drain Value of 2. If the spirit’s Force is greater than your Magic rating, the Drain is Physical; otherwise, it’s Stun.

**Glitches**: A glitch on conjuring can result in the wrong spirit type (but still one within the summoner’s tradition), a spirit of lesser force (who makes the Opposed Test at the Force the summoner selected) or extra Drain to resist.

On a critical glitch, Drain may not be resisted at all or double the Drain must be resisted or the spirit could be summoned, but not under the summoner’s control – wishing to have a “conversation” about how some spirits feel the practices of summoning and binding is a form of slavery.
### **Binding**
Binding is used summon a spirit and bind it to you so that you may later call it to perform services for you. This takes one hour per Force of the spirit being bound. The test is an Opposed Binding + Magic [Astral] against the spirit’s Force x2, and inflicts Drain equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit’s defence test, minimum 2. Additional net hits beyond the first add to the number of services the spirit owes to a maximum of the spirit’s Force x2.

Once the spirit is bound, its service ends when it has no more services owed to the magician. The bound spirit can be called or dismissed with a Simple Action as they appear next to the magician from the metaplane, awaiting further instructions on the astral. A magician can bind up to their Charisma attribute in spirits.
### **Banishing**
Banishing is severing the bond between a spirit and its summoner. Banishing is a Complex Action. You make an Opposed Banishing + Magic [Astral] Test. This test is opposed by the spirit’s Force (+ the summoner’s Magic if the spirit is bound). For every net hit you get, the number of services the spirit owes is reduced by 1. If you reduce the spirit’s owed services to zero, it’s free and departs on its next action.

The Drain Value for banishing is equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the spirit’s defence test, with a minimum Drain Value of 2. If the spirit’s Force is greater than your Magic rating, the Drain is Physical, otherwise it’s Stun. 

When the bond is broken, the spirit returns to its own plane. This is not the same as disrupting a spirit and forcing it back to its home plane – while it interrupts the spirit the spirit at what it’s doing and may be annoying, banishing is not as downright unpleasant as disruptions (and a spirit engaged in a tedious task might not mind being banished in the least).
### **Spirit Services**
Services are how we measure how helpful a spirit is willing (or required) to be to you. A service is a single task that you request (or demand) from a spirit. If the spirit’s time is up, then any services it still owes are lost to you. The services a spirit can perform are based on whether or not it’s bound to you. Each of the following cost a service.
#### **Unbound Spirit Services**
**Combat**: You can have a spirit fight on your side in combat. The entire fight counts as a single service.

**Power Use**: You can have a spirit use one of its powers on a target or targets of your choosing. If the spirit uses a power as part of another task (often in combat), then the power use doesn’t count as a separate service.

**Physical Task**: A spirit can materialise to perform actions on the physical plane for you.

**Remote Service**: If you send a spirit to complete a service beyond your Magic rating x 100 metres, it’s a remote service. Once the spirit is done with a remote service, it is released and goes to its home metaplane, no matter how many services it still owes you.
#### **Bound Spirit Services**
**Unbound Spirit Service**: You can have a bound spirit do any of the things an unbound spirit can do for you. If you have a bound spirit perform a remote service, you don’t lose any extra services when it’s done and it comes back to you when it’s finished.

**Aid Alchemy, Sorcery and Study**: As a service, the spirit can add its Force as a dice pool bonus to your Alchemy, Spellcasting, Ritual Spellcasting and Learning Tests if its type matches the spell’s category, as listed under your tradition.

**Spell Sustaining**: You can have a spirit sustain a spell for you after you cast it. It takes the -2 dice pool penalty per sustained spell, instead of you. It can’t do this forever, only for its Force in Combat Turns for each service you spend on spell sustaining.
### **Common Spirit Powers**
Spirits are denizens of the metaplanes. They’re usually only found when a magician summons them, but there are many free spirits who live unbound on the material plane. They only have physical attributes when materialised in the physical plane. Most spirits possess the common powers listed below.

|Astral Form|<p>A spirit with this power only exists in the astral plane. Only astral attacks or mana spells/powers may hurt a spirit; physical attacks or spells/powers have no effect. The reverse is also true; the spirit can only affect dual-natured beings or those on the astral plane, whether through astral projection or astral perception.</p><p>Spirits may manifest on the physical plane in the same way as astrally projecting magicians.</p>|
| :- | :- |
|Materialisation|This spirit can project themselves into the physical world and form a temporary “body” to inhabit while they’re here. This lets it interact with, and affect, physical beings. Additionally, it gains Spirit Armour equal to twice its Essence. Materialising and dematerializing to return to the astral plane both require a Complex Action.|
|Spirit Armour|Spirits are harmed more by the force of will behind an attack than the physical attack itself. Mana spells and/or powers deal their normal damage to spirits. The DV of normal melee attacks is the Willpower of the attacker while Strength and similarly physical modifiers are ignored. Standard firearms do not penetrate Spirit Armour as there is no individual’s will behind the force of the bullets. However, a thrown weapon such as a knife may still have the will of the attacker backing it up and therefore able to deal damage to the spirit with a DV of Willpower/2 (round up).|

**<a name="_toc218024805"></a>ENCHANTING**\

==========================================
Enchanting is the technique of tapping into the fundamental power latent in natural elements and imbuing items with magic that aids and enhances a magician’s abilities. With it, you can enchant items with spells, create magical foci and break down magical items into component reagents.
### **Alchemy**
From mystic flamethrowers to preparing a six-demon bag, alchemy allows the magician to prepare objects that hold a spell to be released later. The object used as a preparation must be small enough for the magician to lift, handle and manipulate. The magician alters, marks, sculpts or otherwise adds a creative touch to the object in the process of making it a preparation. This also makes it recognisable as a preparation with a successful Arcana + Intuition [Mental] Test.

Preparations carry an aura with the astral signature of its creator, which is visible in astral space. The aura and astral signature lasts for a number of hours equal to the magical effect’s Force after activation. Preparations which, when active, sustain a spell, become temporarily dual-natured while the spell is active.

**Choose an Alchemy Formula**: You can only choose an alchemical formula you know. Alchemical formulae are different from Sorcery spells even if they result in the same effect.

**Choose Formula Force**: You must declare the Force at which your preparation will be created. The Force acts as a limit on the preparation, so higher Force preparations are more powerful, but at the cost of more Drain. You can make a preparation at a Force up to twice your Magic rating.

**Choose the Lynchpin for the Preparation**: The object for the preparation is called the lynchpin. It must be small enough for you to lift, handle and manipulate. In addition, the lynchpin must not have any aura already, so living beings are right out.

**Choose Preparation Trigger**: A preparation releases its spell when a condition called the trigger is met. Choose a trigger type for the preparation. The trigger you pick can add to the Drain Value of the preparation.

*Command*: The preparation is triggered by you. You must be on the physical plane (or manifest if you’re astrally projecting), have line of sight to the preparation and take a Simple Action to trigger the preparation. You have some control over the preparation’s target with this trigger.

*Contact*: The next living being to touch the preparation activates the spell. This trigger adds +1 Drain.

*Reading*: The preparation is triggered by reading the inscribed/painted/written words/runes/sigils. This trigger adds +1 Drain.

*Time*: Choose an amount of time when picking this trigger. The countdown starts at the end of the creation of the preparation and the preparation is activated when the time’s up. The time you declare is limited by the final Potency of the preparation in hours – if the time is greater than the resulting Potency after creation, the preparation activates prematurely. This trigger adds +2 Drain to the creation of the preparation.

**Create the Preparation**: Once everything else is settled, you need to spend uninterrupted time crafting the lynchpin into a preparation – a number of minutes equal to the preparation’s Force. You spend this time drawing arcane formulae, carving symbols or hieroglyphs, mixing materials into the lynchpin or some other time-honoured way of working your magic that relates to your tradition – the higher the Force, the more complex and intricate your work.

After the time elapses for creation of the preparation, make an Alchemy + Magic [Force] Test opposed by the Force of the preparation. The net hits from this test becomes the preparation’s Potency. If you get no net hits, the Preparation fails, the time is wasted and you still take drain.

**Resist Drain**: Drain for a preparation is based on the alchemical formula, plus any additional Drain based on the chosen trigger. If you get more hits on your Alchemy Test than your Magic rating, the Drain is Physical, otherwise it’s Stun.

**Glitches**: On a glitch, you may have put the wrong trigger on the preparation or the duration of a time trigger could be off or the preparation may resist at a higher force than usual (+2 to Force). On a critical glitch – well, we wouldn’t recommend drinking whatever the end result is. It may blow up in your hand when you move it. Or something equally unpleasant your gamesmaster comes up with. It’s probably best just to step away (or run) from the preparation until the Potency fades.

**The Finished Preparation**: An alchemical preparation is a temporary form of magic. The preparation’s Potency determines how many hours the magic can be sustained and how strong the preparation’s spell is when activated. The preparation maintains full Potency for [Potency x2] hours. For every hour that passes after that period, the preparation’s Potency is reduced by 1.
### **Alchemical Preparation Formulae Examples**
#### **Boneshatter Rune**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-6||
Inscribed upon a weapon its magical power remains inert until awoken by tracing a finger over the rune. Then the next strike channels bone-shattering energies into the foe, adding Physical damage equal to the preparation’s Potency, resisted with Body.
#### **Camouflage Cloak**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F-2|Realistic|

A cloak is the most common lynchpin for this effect. With hermetic mages stitching runes of power around the edges. The wearer is coloured in a camouflage pattern that matches their surroundings and provides one die per hit to resist attempts to spot their physical body. This effect works against living viewers and technological sensors.
#### **Explosive Runes**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Elemental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-1||
Upon the inscribed runes being read, an explosion of flames flash into existence and scorch the surrounds. Fire damage equal to the preparation’s Potency + Force is dealt with a Fire AP equal to the preparation’s Force in a radius in metres equal to the Force of the preparation. To determine if something in the explosion range catches fire, roll Armour Value + Fire Resistance – Fire AP. The threshold on this test is the Potency of the preparation. If caught on fire, at the end of each Combat Turn, the fire has an initial DV of 3 and the DV increases by 1 at the start of each subsequent Combat turn until the item is completely destroyed or the fire is put out. You can fight the fire in a number of ways (water, smothering, etc.) making an Agility + Intuition Test and reducing the fire’s DV by 1 for each hit.
#### **Eye of Awareness**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F|Psychic|

Commonly prepared using an amulet or necklace as the lynchpin, when activated, your awareness expands, allowing you to subconsciously analyse combat and other dangerous situations with range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Each point of Potency grants a +1 dice pool bonus to Surprise Tests and against ranged and melee attacks.
#### **Featherfall Token**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F-3||
Often a small circular token that is snapped to slow a target’s fall to help them land safely without suffering fall damage. When determining the maximum distance (in metres) the target may fall without danger of injury, multiply the successes on the Potency + Force [Force] Test by the spell’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the spell before calculating damage.
#### **Mindnet**

|Type: Mana|Range: F x M x 10m|Extended Area|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Hr/F|Drain: F+1|Psychic|

A small copper net that fits in the palm of your hand is the typical lynchpin. Mindnet allows telepathic communication between a group of voluntary people. To connect to the Mindnet, one must touch a strand of the net. Everyone in the group can freely talk and emote as long as they remain within range of the lynchpin.
#### **Mist Globe**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-4|Area|

A tiny, glass globe the size of a marble that appears to contain swirling mist. When shattered, a thick fog rapidly blankets the area proving dense and difficult to see through, imposing a visibility modifier equal to the Potency. The mist can be dissipated by temperature and winds.
#### **Painstone**

|<a name="_hlk212804858"></a>Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Min/F|Drain: F-4||
This jagged-edged stone absorbs the pain of injuries that would otherwise be felt by the user. It is activated by drawing a drop of the user’s blood on the sharp stone. The user ignores the pain of injuries, reducing penalties from Physical or Stun damage. The activation test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). Each hit on the Potency + Force [Force] Test removes the effect of one point of wound penalties.
### **Using a Preparation**
When the spell is released from the preparation, it goes off as though it were cast by a magician. The preparation uses Potency + Force [Force]. If the effect is sustained, it lasts for a duration as listed in the alchemical preparation formula. There is no Drain in this because it was already taken by the alchemist; likewise, no Edge can be spent on the preparation activation.

The target(s) of a preparation must be on the physical plane.
### **Artificing**
Enchanting is the technique of tapping into the fundamental power latent in natural elements and imbuing items with magic that aids and enhances a magician’s abilities. The act of creating a magical focus is known as artificing. Unlike other magical goods, a focus is powerful, reusable and intimately tied to its owner. A focus represents a permanent and complex enchantment built up slowly from an arcane formula and finished with Karm. All foci follow the same basic creation process: first a focus formula is needed, then an appropriate telesma (the material item to be enchanted) is selected. After that the enchantment proper is created and finally the finished focus is bonded.

**Choose Focus Formula**: Designing a focus requires a complex arcane recipe known as a focus formula. Focus formulae, like all magical formulae, are produced using the Arcana skill. They are too complex for metahuman magicians to memorise and must be recorded in some fashion. You can buy focus formulae from lore stores and talismongers.

All focus formulae specify the type of focus, Force, form and tradition of the focus. The formulae sold by talismongers typically use “traditional” forms in widespread magical traditions – which is why a lot of magicians commonly create their own formulae. The focus formula must be for a Force that is equal to or less than your Magic Rating – you cannot make foci with ratings greater than your Magic rating.

If you’d rather create your own focus formula, you can design one from scratch. Researching a focus formula is an Arcana + Magic [Astral] (Force x Force, 1 day) Extended Test. Once complete, the focus formula may be used by any magician of your tradition to make the specific focus. A magician can translate a focus formula from another tradition into their own with an Arcana + Magic [Astral] (Force, 1 day) Extended Test.

**Obtain the Telesma**: Before you can create a focus, you need to acquire an item that matches the form defined in the focus formula. An object being prepared for enchantment in this manner is known as a telesma. Obtaining telesma may be simple or complex – if the formula calls for a knife it may be no more difficult than buying a blade from the local Weapons World franchise, but if the formula calls for a flute carved from the bones of a California condor, you might need to do some work to track down the item in question. Any inanimate object can serve as the telesma: a wooden wand, a jewelled charm, a weapon, an oddly shaped stone, and so on. The more unprocessed and natural the object, or the more work you performed to craft it, the easier the telesma is to enchant. For this reason, enchanters with the technical or artistic skill to do so often create telesma themselves.

**Prepare the Magical Lodge**: You’ll need a magical lodge with a Force at least equal to that of the formula Force, and of the same tradition as yourself and the focus formula. While you’re there, make sure you add some amenities, because you’re going to be in there for a while.

**Spend Reagents**: The reagents you need specified in the focus formula. Consumable reagents are considered spent at the start of the process, so they are used up even if you fail or abort the crafting.

**Craft the Focus**: You need to spend a number of days equal to the Force in the focus formula. You use this time to gather mana, hanging it on the telesma and working it into the material permanently. You’re actually working sporadically over the course of each day, so you can do other business during this time, but you can’t leave the lodge without ruining your crafting attempt.

At the end of the crafting time, it is time for the dangerous part of the process: invoking the power of the focus. Make an Artificing + Magic [formula Force] v formula Force + telesma’s Object Resistance. This counts as the culmination of all your work over the days, so you can’t use Edge for this test. Your net hits from this test, if you succeed, become the focus’s actual Force. If you glitch, you cannot resist Drain in the next step. If you critically glitch, the magic spins out of your control and rips away Essence from you – artificing is not for the weak or untrained.

**Resist Drain**: The Drain Value is the Force specified by the focus formula, plus 2 for each hit (not net hit) rolled against you in the Artificing test; the Drain is Physical if the actual Force of the focus somehow ends up greater than your Magic rating. If you’re still conscious after resisting Drain, you can spend an amount of karma equal to the actual Force of the focus to seal the deal and finish the focus. If you fall unconscious or don’t want to keep the result, skip the karma expenditure and start over (probably after you’ve healed).

The Artificing skill also allows you to assense a focus in a way that helps you understand its creator. Make an Opposed Test of Artificing + Magic [Astral] v twice the Force of the focus. You can use the net hits to learn about the aura of the artificer who crafter it. This can be attempted once a day per focus.
### **Disenchanting**
The Disenchanting skill allows the magician to temporarily disrupt or even unweave astral constructs.

**Disenchant**: To deactivate an active focus, make an Opposed Disenchanting + Magic [Astral] v the target‘s Force + owner’s Magic Test. You can do this from the physical or astral plane, though you must have line of sight to the focus. If you get more successes on the test, the focus deactivates.

The Drain Value for this test is 1 Stun per hit (not net hit) rolled against the magician; if the target’s Force exceeds the magician’s Magic rating, the Drain is Physical. If the target’s Force exceeds twice their Magic rating, then that item’s a bit more than the mage can handle and they cannot successfully perform Disenchant.

**Disjunction**: A focus can be destroyed and broken down into reagents. This requires touch contact with the focus. Breaking down a focus requires an Opposed Disenchanting + Magic [Astral] v the target’s Force (+ owner’s Magic if bonded and if the focus isn’t yours) Test. If you succeed in this test, the focus ceases to be. The telesma at the heart of it disintegrates and is unusable.

The mana released can be channelled into objects of the magician’s tradition, making them into reagents. Make an Alchemy + Magic [Astral] Test. Every success creates one reagent, up to a maximum of half of the reagents used in creating the focus. This process takes a number of hours equal to the target’s Force.

The Drain Value for these tests are 1 Stun per hit (not net hit) rolled against the magician; if the target’s Force exceeds the magician’s Magic rating, the Drain is Physical. If the target’s Force exceeds twice their Magic rating, then that item’s a bit more than the mage can handle and they cannot successfully perform Disjunction.

**Disjoining**: Put simply, disjoining is to Alchemy as dispelling is to Spellcasting. Disjoining allows you to remove the magic power from a preparation, making it into an ordinary object again. To disjoin a preparation, you need to have assensed the object and you need to touch it to make the attempt. Disjoining takes a Complex Action and you make an Opposed Disenchanting + Magic [Astral] Test v the preparation’s Force + the alchemist’s Magic Rating. Every net hit reduces the preparation’s Potency by 1. You then take the same amount of Drain as you would have if you’d created the preparation yourself.

There’s a risk to doing this – if the preparation has a contact trigger and you fail the Disenchanting Test, the preparation activates. Better hope it’s not explosive.


**<a name="_toc218024806"></a>SORCERY**\

=======================================
Sorcery is the art of shaping mana to create specific effects. You can use it to cast spells (Spellcasting and Ritual Spellcasting) or protect against or destroy spells (Counterspelling). You need to concentrate to cast a spell, but traditions may also include chanting, gestures, dancing or other actions to go along with it.

This specialisation of Perception is called Numinous Perception, which includes both the chilly tingle of astral forms and the “vibes” of noticing magic. With a Simple Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test with a threshold equal to the absolute value of the Skill Rating of the caster minus the Force of the magic (minimum 1).

Obviously, it a magician is throwing fire from their fingertips, you’re probably going to notice without making a test. But if the magic is subtle, then you have to pick up some dice.
### **Spellcasting**
Select a known spell. Select the target(s). Select the spell’s Force.

You need to be able to establish a link to your target – depending on the spell, you’ll need to be able to see or touch the target in order to establish the mystical link.

If you need to see the target, line of sight can be established with your natural vision, including using reflective surfaces and looking through transparent objects. Cyber- or bio-ware visual enhancements that have been paid for this Essence count as natural.

Any technological visual aid that digitises or augments the visual input for you (a camera, electronic binoculars, Matrix feeds, etc) doesn’t work – you’re looking at a generated image, not the light from the real target.

Spellcasting by visual targeting is subject to normal visibility modifiers. You can target astral targets when you’re in astral space (you’re not technically seeing them, but the analogy works).

Some spells can only be cast on target that you’re touching. You don’t need to see these targets, but you might need to make an unarmed attack to make contact with an unwilling target. Touching a target through clothing, armour or layer of paint is acceptable.

A magician in the physical world can only cast spells on targets that are in the physical world. Similarly, a magician in astral space can only cast spells on targets that are present in astral space.

If you’re using astral perception (or are dual-natured), you can cast spells on targets in either the physical world or the astral plane. Only mana-based spells work in astral space, even if you’re in the physical world astrally perceiving the target.

The Force of a spell acts as a limit on the spell. Higher Force spells are more powerful but cause more Drain. You can cast a spell at a Force of up to twice your Magic Rating. If the number of hits (not net hits) you get after applying the limit exceeds your Magic rating, the spell’s Drain is Physical instead of Stun damage.

Casting a spell involves some mental preparation and a Complex Action. Make a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] Test, including dice pool modifiers, for injury, sustained spells and so on. Any opposition roll or threshold you need to reach is listed in the spell description. 

**Rapid Spellcasting**: You can bypass some of the preparation, but it can take a toll on your body. Rapid Spellcasting lets you cast a spell as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action, but with an added +3 Drain Value. If you decide to cast two spells Simple Actions in the same Action Phase, both receive the +3 Drain Value.

**Determine Effect**: Details on the type of spell are listed under each spell. Some spells require an Opposed Test prior to resolution, while others can possibly be dodged by the target. Note that the effect takes space even if Drain takes you out.

**Drain**: Drain calculation is listed for each spell; the Drain Value is determined using the Force and the listed calculation but can never be lower than 2. After casting a spell, you must resist Drain using the dice pool for Drain Resistance according to your tradition.

**Determine Ongoing Effects**: If you sustain the spell (that is, if you want the effect of a Sustained spell to continue), you take a dice pool penalty to all tests while it is sustained as noted in the spell description. You can sustain multiple spells, but the penalty is cumulative for each spell.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a spell might cause extra drain (generally a +2 Drain Value), invoke a different elemental effect than what was intended, hit the wrong target or any other bit of mischief your gamesmaster can think up. On a critical glitch, the spell could get away from you and cause all sorts of havoc or you might not get to resist Drain or it could go off in an unconventional and unpredictable manner that could harm you or your team – again, your gamesmaster gets to decide what happens.
### **Spell Characteristics**
**Type**: Spells are either Physical spells (P) or Mana spells (M).

**Range**: This describes how close you have to get or how far away you can be to cast the spell. The most common range is Line of Sight (LOS). Some spells require you to Touch (T) the target – if the target is unwilling, you’ll need to make an unarmed attack against the target.

**Area**: Area spells (A) affect an area rather than a single target. With a few exceptions, the area is a radius in meters equal to the Force of the spell.

**Damage**: If the spell inflicts damage, this describes the type – either Physical (P) or Stun (S). The Damage Value for the spells is listed in the spell or spell category description.

**Duration**: This describes how long the spell’s effect lasts. Instantaneous (I) spells have an effect that happens and then fades, while Sustained (S) spells last as long as you keep them going. Permanent (P) spells don’t fade or dissipate; their effect becomes a lasting, non-magical characteristic after you sustain the spell for (Force) Combat Turns.

**Drain**: This is the formula used to calculate the Drain Value inflicted by a spell. It is based on the Force (F) of the spell and can never be below 2.

**Indirect**: All indirect combat spells originate near the magician’s body (most magicians use their hands or eyes, but some use their feet for “power kicks” or emanate power from the entire body for a kind of an aura-throwing effect). So, you don’t really need to be able to see the target – you can cast these spells blindfolded or with artificial image enhancement – as long as you’ve got a clear line of fire.
### **Physical vs Mana**
**Physical spells**: When using Physical spells, the magician converts the channelled mana to energy and/or tangible material in the physical world. The tangible material is simple – energy or matter such as ice, acid, oxygen, heat, light, etc. This material is also temporary unless sustained, converting back to mana energy when the spell ends. Physical spells can affect both living and non-living objects in the physical world.

**Mana spells**: When using Mana spells, the magician can only affect living things with auras or astrally active entities (such as spirits or foci) even in the physical world. Mana spells can affect targets on either the physical or astral planes, but only if you’re on the same plane as your target(s).
### **Spell Categories**
**Combat**: These spells are quick, dirty and violent. The energy of the spell is used to harm, main or otherwise frag the target. Spell energy may be channelled directly into the target or it may generate external energy to damage the target from the outside.

**Detection**: These spells enhance the senses. They may allow the subject of the spell to see or hear over great distances or grant new sensory abilities. There are also Detection spells to sense the presence of other beings, magic, life and/or enemies.

**Health**: These spells affect the condition and performance of a living body. They can be used to treat or heal injuries, purge poisons or toxins and increase or decrease Attributes.

**Illusion**: These spells can mess with a target’s perception. They can be used to deceive, make things invisible, confuse the senses or provide simple or complex entertainments.

**Manipulation**: These spells are used by magicians to alter and shape their environment in a variety of ways. They can control the emotions or actions of a person, move objects, shape, create or channel energy or change a target’s form or appearance by altering its structure.
### **Combat Spells**

**Blaze**

The damage inflicted is similar to massive cellular die off from radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but without the continuing effects. Since they are mana spells, they only affect living and magical targets. It inflicts damage equal to your net hits on a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] Test resisted by Willpower.

**Fireball**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Damage: P|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F|Aimed|

The magician creates an explosion of flames that flash into existence and scorch the target(s), giving them the double benefit of causing pain and being intimidating as hell. The area of effect is a radius in meters equal to the Force of the spell. The spell is targeted with a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] versus the target’s Reaction + Intuition.  It strikes the target dealing Force + net hits damage, with an AP equal to –(Force) and resisted by Body + Fire Resistance. Roll an Armour Value + Fire Resistance –[Force]. The threshold on this test is the net hits rolled on the fire-based attack. On a fail, the target is set on fire.

Cold snaps into ice that grasps the target, typically binding their legs to the ground, although it could be used to bind an arm to a wall instead. It inflicts damage equal to your net hits on a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] Test resisted by Body + Cold Resistance. If at least one damage is inflicted, the target has a limb (or limbs) immobilised. The target may attempt to break free with a Complex Action, rolling Strength + Body against the net hits of the spell.

**Frost Shards**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Damage: P|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3|Aimed|

The magician directs a flurry of icy wind and shards of ice at the target with a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] versus the target’s Reaction + Intuition.  It strikes the target dealing Force + net hits damage, with an AP equal to –(Force) and resisted by Body + Cold Resistance. This may damage gear as liquid components freeze, lubricants gum up and other parts become brittle.

**Ice Sheet**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F|Area|

This spell creates a slippery sheet of ice over the area of effect. Characters crossing the ice must make an Agility + Reaction Test with a threshold equal to the hits you score to avoid falling prone. Vehicles must make an immediate Crash Test.

It strikes the target dealing Force + net hits damage, with an AP equal to –(Force) and resisted by Body + Electrical Resistance. The target suffers a -1 dice pool penalty on all actions and Defence Tests (but not Damage Resistance Tests) for 1 Combat Turn and an immediate Initiative Score reduction of 5. Drones or other electronics targeted also take Matrix damage equal to half the Physical damage (rounded down).

**Mana Ball**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Damage: P|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F|Direct, Area|

This spell channels destructive magical power into the target, doing Physical damage. The damage inflicted is similar to massive cellular die off from radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but without the continuing effects.

**Mystic Blade**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Damage: P|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F|Aimed|

An arcane blade materialises just long enough to slice at the target, attacking with a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] versus the target’s Reaction + Intuition. It strikes the target dealing Force -2 + net hits damage, with an AP equal to –(Force +4) and resisted by Body + Armour.

**Sleep Touch**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Damage: S|

### **Detection Spells**

**Clairaudience**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The listening point may be moved to another point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. A ward or mana barrier prevents the visual point from entered that area. The range of the listening point is Force x Magic in metres and does not require line of sight. While using Clairaudience, the subject cannot use their normal hearing. This spell translates only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing.

**Clairvoyance**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The visual point may be moved to another point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. A ward or mana barrier prevents the visual point from entered that area. The range of the visual point is Force x Magic in metres and does not require line of sight. While using Clairvoyance, the subject cannot use their normal vision or astral perception. This spell translates only vision and doesn’t work with augmented vision. You can’t target spells through Clairvoyance.

**Detect Life**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Active|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Area|

The subject can attempt to detect all living being (but not spirits) within range of the sense and their number and relative location. The range of detection is Force x Magic in metres. The net hits determine the level of the information provided. In a crowded area, the spell is virtually useless, picking up a blurred mass of traces of life.

**Detect Magic**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Active|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-2|Area|

The subject can attempt to detect the presence of all foci, spells, wards, magical lodges, alchemical preparations, active rituals and spirits within range of the sense. The range of detection is Force x Magic in metres. The net hits determine the level of the information provided. It does not detect Awakened characters or critters, astral signatures, alchemical preparations that have expired or already triggered or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.

**Diagnose**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Active|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3||
Diagnose grants the subject information on the target’s general health and any illnesses, injuries or other mundane medical problems the target might possess. The net hits determine the level of the information provided. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell

**Low-Light Vision**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Passive|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Directional|

The subject gains low-light vision for the duration of the spell.

### **Health Spells**

**Ambidexterity**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: \*|Drain: F-3||
This spell allows the spellcaster to temporarily grant ambidexterity, handling objects equally well with either hand. The subject does not suffer the -2 dice pool penalty for actions with the off-hand. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). The duration is equal to the spell’s Force + net hits on the Spellcasting Test in Combat Turns.

**Detoxify**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-3||
This spell is used to attempt to overcome toxins and poisons. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). Add the hits from this spell directly to the hits from the Toxin Resistance Test.



**Heal**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: S-P|Drain: F-4||
Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell’s hits from the Spellcasting Test. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). The effect becomes a lasting, non-magical characteristic after being sustained for (Force) Combat Turns. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.

**Increase Reflexes**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -3|Drain: F||
This spell increases the initiative of a subject. Each hit rolled on the Spellcasting Test adds +1 to the target’s Initiative and every two hits adds one Initiative Die. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). A character can only be affected by a single Increase Reflexes spell at a time and the maximum Initiative Dice anyone can have is +5D6. The bonus does not stack with Initiative bonuses gained through cyberware.

**Resist Pain**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-4||
This spell allows the subject to ignore the pain of injuries, reducing penalties from Physical or Stun damage. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). Each hit on the Spellcasting Test removes the effect of one point of wound penalties. A person can only be under the effects of one Resist Pain spell at a time (the one with the most hits).

**Stabilise**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Essence|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: S-P|Drain: F-4||
When applied to a character with a filled Physical damage track, this spell stabilises all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell’s Force must equal or exceed the overflow damage already taken when the spell starts. Your Spellcasting Test takes a dice pool penalty equal to the target’s Essence loss (rounded up). The effect becomes a lasting, non-magical characteristic after being sustained for Combat Turns equal to the overflow damage. The spell must be sustained until the full time is taken for the spell to become permanent before the character is truly stabilised; hits reduce the time it takes by 1 Combat Turn each. If successful, the spell prevents the character from taking further damage from Physical Damage Overflow. 

### **Illusion Spells**

**Agony**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-4|Single Sense|

A favourite of mages going through bad break-ups, Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on the target. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, they are racked with pain, unable to move or act. The spell is resisted with a Logic + Willpower Test against using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Test. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.

**Agony, Mass**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Area, Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-2|Single Sense|

Mass Agony inflicts an illusion of terrible pain on targets with a radius of [Force] metres. Each net hit scored by the magician temporarily inflicts 1 box of Physical and 1 box of Stun damage on the target. It is not actual damage, only a measure of the effect of the spell. The target is affected the same as if the damage were real, with the usual injury penalties. If the target’s damage boxes are completely filled, they are racked with pain, unable to move or act. The spell is resisted with a Logic + Willpower Test against using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Test. Once the spell is ended, the pain and damage boxes immediately go away.

**Full Sensory Illusionary Mask**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-1|Multi-Sense|

The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape as their natural form) chosen by the magician. This spell alters the subject’s appearance, voice, scent and other sensory characteristics as well.

Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Tests with an Intuition + Logic Test. This spell creates an illusion that affects both living beings and technological systems. It does not affect auras.

**Invisibility**

|Type: Mana|Range: LOS|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-2|Single-Sense|

This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by other senses (hearing, smell, touch and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Their aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell with a Logic + Willpower Test. Make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if their good enough with their Sneaking Test.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers.

**Sound Barrier**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Area, Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-3|Single-Sense|

The spellcaster creates a perimeter of silence around the area of effect, (Force) in metres. Those inside the sound barrier cannot hear outside noises but can hear sounds within the globe and vice versa. Sound Barrier also affects technological devices, infrasound and ultrasound.

**Visual Illusionary Mask**

|Type: Mana|Range: Touch|Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-4|Single Sense|

The subject assumes a different physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape as their natural form) chosen by the magician. This spell only alters the subject’s visual appearance.

Anyone who might see through the disguise must first successfully resist the spell using the threshold of the hits on the Spellcasting Tests with a Logic + Willpower Test. This spell creates an illusion that affects the minds of living beings and is ineffective against technological systems. It does not affect auras.

**Voice From Everywhere**

|Type: Physical|Range: Touch|Area, Realistic|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-4|Single Sense|

The strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown You project your mystical energy through your voice. Your voice seems to come from everywhere and nowhere specific in the room (or area). It leaves those who hear your voice unable to detect your location from the sound. While able to hear your voice, they don’t know where you are. You could be anywhere: even right behind them.

### **Manipulation Spells**

**Armour**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-2||
This spell creates a field of magical energy wrapped around the subject’s aura that protects against Physical Damage. It provides Armour equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armour.

**Catfall**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-3||
A spellcaster may utilise Catfall to slow a target’s fall to help them land safely without suffering fall damage. When determining the maximum distance (in metres) the target may fall without danger of injury, multiply the spellcaster’s hits by the spell’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the spell before calculating damage.

**Deflection**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-1||
Deflection grants the spellcaster the ability to cast a spell of protection over a willing target. Every hit scored grants the target a +1 dice pool bonus for defending against ranged physical attacks. The effects of this spell are subtle enough to be discounted as a missed shot or poor aim (at least at first).

**Light**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -1|Drain: F-4|Area|

This spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around it equal to the spell’s Force in meters. This spell cannot be used to blind a target, but it offsets darkness visibility modifiers. Each hit on the Spellcasting Test counters a -1 dice pool penalty due to light conditions.

**Lock**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Physical|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Sustain -2|Drain: F-2||
Lock allows the spellcaster to telekinetically hold a door (or portal, hatch, closure or similar blockage) closed with a Strength equal to the Force. Opening the portal requires an Opposed Test between Strength and the spell’s Force.

**Mist**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3|Area|

Mist creates a thick fog that blankets the entire area of effect. The mist is dense and difficult to see through, imposing a visibility modifier equal to the hits scored by the caster. The mist dissipates quickly based on the surrounding temperature and winds. Generally speaking, this means the vision modifier is reduced by 1 per Combat Turn, modified by the temperature and winds.

**Sterilise**

|Type: Physical|Range: LOS|Environmental|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Duration: Instant|Drain: F-3|Area|

This spell allows a spellcaster to kill all bacteria (and other microorganisms) and destroy organic material such as skin flakes, stray hairs and spilled blood. Material affected by this spell cannot be used as a material link. Because the spell does not affect biomaterial attached to a living being, it does not kill the various helpful and harmful microorganisms living inside a creature. Each hit scored by the caster inflicts a -1 dice pool penalty to any skill tests made to collect and use sterilised biomaterial for forensics purposes. Shadowrunners often employ this spell to eliminate incriminating trace evidence, especially if blood has been spilled. The area sterilised equals the caster’s Magic Rating in cubic metres.

### **Counterspelling**
Counterspelling offers the magician two benefits: spell defence and dispelling. The Counterspelling skill does not work against spirits, critter powers or alchemical preparations.

**Spell Defence**: Spell Defence is used against hostile spells cast at you or at targets that are within your line of sight that you decide to protect with spell defence. 

*Spell Shielding*: As a Bonus Action, select a number of people (including yourself if you desire) within 1 metre per point of Counterspelling skill. Dice equal to your Counterspelling skill are added to the defence test against spells of everyone you’re covering. This lasts until the end of the Combat Turn.

*Spellbreaking*: As an Interrupt Action that reduces your Initiative Score by 5, when a spellcaster is casting a spell. Make a Counterspelling + Magic [Astral] Test; each hit reduces the hits of the opposing spellcaster’s spellcasting test.

**Dispelling**: Dispelling is used to counter a sustained spell. A Dispelling Test is the dispeller’s Counterspelling + Magic [Astral] against the spell’s Force + caster’s Magic. Every net hit reduces the number of hits the caster had in casting the spell. This may reduce the effectiveness of the spell. If the spell is reduced to 0 net hits, the spell ends completely. Regardless of how it goes, you take the Drain from the spell as if you had cast it – Physical if the spell’s Force was higher than your Magic rating, Stun otherwise.

**Ritual Drain**: A ritual can be drained of power if it contains the “Spell” keyword and is ongoing (sustained or with a duration). Make an Opposed Counterspelling + Magic [Astral] Test against a dice pool equal to the sum of the Force of the spell and the total of the Magic Ratings of all the ritual’s participants. Every net hit you get reduces the net hits from the ritual’s sealing step by 1. You take drain equal to twice the hits (not net hits) on the opposing test. The Drain from draining a ritual is Stun unless the ritual’s Force is greater than your Magic rating, in which case the Drain is Physical.
### **Ritual Spellcasting**
While spellcasting is the quick manipulation of mana, ritual spellcasting shapes mana over a longer period of time. More time allows you to manipulate mana in ways that normal spellcasting won’t allow. Rituals can be performed by either one person or a group.

**Choose Ritual Leader**: Each ritual must have a leader who know the ritual being performed and can complete the last step, which seals the ritual. The participants do not need to have learned the ritual; they simply must be willing to take part. All effects from the ritual have the leader’s **astral signature**. Participants who are not of the same tradition as the leader suffer a minimum of a -2 dice pool penalty on all actions for the ritual. If you’re casting a ritual all alone, you’re the leader.

**Choose Ritual**: The leader must then choose the ritual to perform. If required, the leader also chooses the spell that will be included as part of the ritual. If the ritual requires knowledge of a spell or spell category, only the leader needs to know them.

**Choose the Force**: The Force of the ritual determines not only its general power, but also the Force of any spell woven into it.

**Set Up the Foundation**: A ritual must be performed in a magical lodge appropriate to the leader’s tradition, which is referred to as the foundation for the ritual. This can be a permanent magical lodge, or a temporary one. The Force of the lodge must equal or exceed the Force of the ritual to be cast. Once the lodge is active, no participant (except a spotter, if the ritual calls for one) may leave the foundation until the ritual is complete without causing the ritual to fail.

**Perform the Ritual**: The duration of this step is specific to each ritual (see their descriptions), but is almost always based on the ritual’s Force.

**Seal the Ritual**: The final step in any ritual is sealing it, which completes the ritual. The leader makes a Ritual Spellcasting + Magic [Force] v (Force x2) test, with a Teamwork Test from each of the participants. Each ritual’s description explains how the net hits from the sealing step are used, if at all.

After the spell effect goes off, each participant also takes Drain equal to twice the number of hits (not net hits) on the defence side of the Ritual Spellcasting Test (minimum 2). If the number of hits the leader got on their Teamwork Test was higher than their Magic rating, this drain is Physical; otherwise, it’s Stun.
### **Ritual Failure**
There are a number of things that could cause a ritual to fail prematurely. If a participant leaves the foundation before the ritual is sealed, the ritual fails. If the leader is incapacitated (or killed) before the ritual is sealed, the ritual fails. If the foundation is disrupted or broken before the ritual is sealed, the ritual fails.

When a ritual fails, every participant immediately suffers Drain. Make a Force x 2 Test, as though the spell had actually been cast; the Drain is equal to twice the number of hits (not net hits) on this test in Stun damage.

**Glitches**: A glitch on a ritual in any step could result in extra Drain (e.g. +2 Drain Value), an increase of 2 to the Force resisting completion of the spell or the leader being forced to seal the ritual on their own. On a critical glitch, anything goes (prepare to put down that accidentally summoned demon, find that your astral form has been bound into the ritual focus item, find your healing circle is really an astral gateway and everybody just got dumped on some metaplane or something equally unpleasant).
### **Anchored Rituals**
An anchored ritual is anchored to a physical object (a tree or doorway, for example) or symbol/s of mystical significance to the tradition (written in ink, paint, blood, etch marks, etc.) that serves as the ritual’s focal point. This could be something used specifically for the ritual. While some anchored rituals create an effect that is simply a sphere expanding from the central focus, other allow the ritualist to shape the area of effect with tokens that resonate with the anchoring object or symbols mystically tied to the central symbol that allow the area to fit within the confines of a building or even certain rooms within a building. The anchor cannot be moved relative to the Gaiasphere (the planet) during the duration of the ritual’s effect or the ritual collapses and the effect ends early.
### **Rituals**
These are rituals that you can learn and cast. 

**Alarm Ward**

Alarm Wards alert their creator when a physical form has entered or crossed any area they are set to guard (with a size threshold to prevent a mosquito from triggering the Alarm Ward. Alarm Wards are tenuous, designed to be as unobtrusive as possible so as to blend into the local astral space and allow any intruder to pass through, (hopefully) unaware they have been detected.

*Keywords*: Anchored

*Effect*: Astral entities must make an Assensing + Intuition [Astral] (3) Test to notice the ward before passing through it. Those on the physical realm or using spells like Clairvoyance need to succeed at a Perception Test (5) to notice the ritual marking and anchor of the ward. This is to notice the “magical markings” but not understand their intent. That is a standard Arcane Knowledge Test.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Astral Alarm Ward**

Astral Alarm Wards alert their creator when a spell or astral form has entered or crossed any area they are set to guard. Astral Alarm Wards are tenuous, designed to be as unobtrusive as possible so as to blend into the local astral space and allow any intruder to pass through, (hopefully) unaware they have been detected.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Circle of Protection**

The circle of protection is a small astral and physical barrier. The barrier is dual-natured. Anyone or anything within the barrier is protected from outside physical objects and magical attacks. If something crosses the barrier from the inside, then the circle ends.

*Keywords*: Anchored

*Effect*: The circle acts as a combination of physical barrier and mana barrier with a Force equal to the Force of the ritual.

*Area*: Even though it’s called a circle, it creates a sphere around the anchor that has a radius in metres equal to the leader’s Magic Rating.

*Duration*: 1 hour per net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Dread Domain**

This ritual creates an area of that mystically broadcasts feelings of imminent danger, fear and unease to any living being who enters the domain. They simultaneously feel chilled and nervous. Their hackles rise and they feel slightly panicked. It does not affect the ritualist/s (however, other allies may not be excluded from the effects).

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: Characters that fail to resist suffer a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions for each net hit on the Sealing Test as long as they remain in the area of effect.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour per net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Safe Landing Zone**

This ritual creates an area that slows the fall of those who enter it, helping them to land safely without suffering falling damage.

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: When calculating the maximum distance (in metres) a character has fallen without danger of injury, multiply the ritualist’s hits by the ritual’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the ritual before calculating damage.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour per net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Silence Zone**

This ritual creates a perimeter of silence. Those inside the zone cannot hear outside noises but can hear sounds within the zone and vice versa. Only sounds crossing the zone are affected. It also affects technological devices, infrasound and ultrasound.

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: Perimeter of silence.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Shadowed Domain**

This ritual creates an area of mystical shadows and darkness that restricts vision (does not affect thermographic vision).

*Keywords*: Anchored, Spell

*Effect*: 2 Force for Partial Light, 4 Force for Dim Light and 6 Force for Total Darkness.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: 1 hour (at one hit), which is doubled for each additional net hit from the sealing step of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Ward**

The ward is a basic ritual, taught to many magicians that creates an astral barrier.

*Keywords*: Anchored

*Effect*: It creates an astral barrier with a Force equal to the Force of the ritual.

*Area*: Either a sphere with a radius in metres equal to fifty cubic metres times the sum of the participants’ Magic Ratings and the net hits from the sealing step or a space with the same area or smaller.

*Duration*: Weeks equal to the net hits from the sealing of the ritual.

*Ritual Time*: (Force) hours to perform.

**Watcher**

Watchers are like spirits, but in actuality are entities born from the ritual leader’s own mind rather than the metaplanes. They are a creation of mana, woven with the personalities of the ritual participants. A watcher can speak any language its creators (which include the leader and participants) can speak. A watcher is bound only to the leader of the ritual and follows their orders. Unlike spirits, watchers do not have a telepathic link with the leader. They must communicate with words to pass on a message. A watcher is a minion. A character can’t have more minions at a time that their Charisma rating. A leader can dismiss a watcher bound to them as a Bonus Action. Watchers cannot be banished or counterspelled.

*Keywords*: Minion

*Duration*: Hours equal to Force times the net hits on the sealing test

*Ritual Time*: (Force) minutes to perform.

**<a name="_toc218024807"></a>MENTOR SPIRITS**\

==============================================
In the search for magical enlightenment, affiliation or purpose, many Awakened individuals are drawn toward certain animals, mythological figures or concepts. This may be an idol they grew up with, a tribal totem or something they look up to achieve in their life. It could also relate to their religious or magical beliefs. So strong are the feelings for this person or idea that once the individual Awakens, the idea takes a life of its own. It becomes what is known as a mentor spirit.

This mentor spirit is much like other spirits in that it has its own personality, but it’s not a spirit in the summon-and-banish sense of the term. It can be seen and heard by those it chooses and even physically interact with its followers. Your mentor spirit can have significant influence over you, giving you benefits when you remain true or punishing you if you go astray (sometimes with temporary reductions to your Magic rating).

There is no real understanding of the nature of mentor spirits but their goal is clear. They want to keep Awakened individuals on the path that helped introduce the mentor spirit to the Earth in the first place. Any Awakened character can connect with a mentor spirit by taking the Mentor Spirit quality.
### **Mentor Spirit Archetypes**
Each of the mentor spirits listed here represents an archetype. These archetypes are idealised as totem animals, deities and forces of nature by different cultures and traditions. The archetypes listed below serve merely as examples of different archetypes and are not meant to apply to all cultures – a totem animal considered a healer in one culture may be considered a deceiver in another.

Each archetype offers three advantages: one general bonus, one bonus that applied only to magicians and one that applies only to adepts. Each also has a disadvantage. Advantages and disadvantages apply at all times.
#### **Bear**
This mentor symbolises strength and protection. He is a healer and cannot turn down those in need without good reason and he defends those under his care. Bear is more than a gentle healer; he is a ferocious protector, disregarding his own safety in combat if wounded or if someone he is protecting is injured.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to resist damage (not including Drain)

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for Health spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 1 free level of Rapid Healing

**Disadvantages**

You might go berserk when you take Physical damage in combat or if someone under your care is badly injured. Make a Simple Charisma + Willpower Test (wound modifiers apply). You go berserk for 3 turns minus 1 turn per hit, so 3 or more hits avert the berserk rage entirely. If you’re already going berserk, increase the duration. When you’re berserk, you go after your attacker(s) without regard for your own safety. If you incapacitate the target(s) before the time is up, the berserk fury dissipates.
#### **Cat**
Cat is honoured in cultures around the world. Cat is often seen as the guardian of mystical secrets, including those involving the afterlife. She certainly knows many secrets but rarely decides to share them and never with anyone who is not worthy. She is stealthy, sly and arrogant. Cat toys with her prey – threatening, taunting and confusing her targets – rather than going directly for the kill.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to either Acrobatics or Stealth Tests (choose one)

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for Illusion spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Light Body

**Disadvantages**

Cat magicians toy with their prey. Unless you succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test at the start of combat, you cannot make an attack that incapacitates your target. If you take any Physical damage, all this playing around stops.
#### **Dog**
Dog is a loyal friend. He fights ferociously to defend his home and those under his protection. Dog protects people from harmful magic and dangerous spirits. Dog is loyal, generous and helpful to those who show him kindness. He is single-minded, often to the point of stubbornness.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Tracking Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Detection spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Improved Sense

**Disadvantages**

A Dog magician is stubbornly loyal. You can never leave someone behind, betray your comrades or let another sacrifice themselves in your place without making a successful Charisma + Willpower (3) Test.
#### **Dragonslayer**
This most heroic of mentor spirits is also the most fun loving. Though he fights to protect his own against all dangers, he loves a good party even more. He is a big brother who takes a friendly interest in everything his family does. Though sometimes naïve, he makes a staunch friend and a deadly enemy. The dragons he slays have changed with the times: current beasts include crime, pollution, corruption and, of course, actual dragons. Dragonslayer fights hard and plays hard. Once he has given his oath, he never breaks it. A Dragonslayer magician behaves with honour and respect and demands the same from those around him.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to one social skill of choice

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Combat spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 1 free level of Enhanced Accuracy (skill) and 1 free level of Danger Sense

**Disadvantages**

If you break a promise, whether by choice or accident, you take a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions until you make good on your promise or atone.
#### **Fitness Guru**
Often devoted to self-improvement, those who follow the mentor spirit of fitness treat their bodies as their greatest instrument. Proud not just of their appearance, but of the power and finesse of their motion and actions. A Fitness magician offers respect to those they deem deserve it but at least politeness to those who don’t. However, they demand that others show them respect.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Acrobatics Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Health spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Light Body

**Disadvantages**

Followers of this mentor spirit demand respect, especially to those they give it to. Once disrespected, they must succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test, or they will demand satisfaction against the slight. 
#### **Eagle**
Eagle is the highest-flying bird in the sky, considered the most noble by many cultures. He is proud and solitary and sees everything happening in the world below. Eagles are noble defenders of the purity of nature. They are intolerant of those who do not share their views and have a strong distrust of technology and its tools. Those who damage nature are Eagle’s enemies and Eagle will brave great danger to defeat polluters and other evildoers.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Perception Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for summoning spirits of air

**Adept**: 1 free level of Combat Sense

**Disadvantages**

You get the Allergy – Mild Pollutants quality with no bonus Karma for this negative quality.
#### **Oak**
Followers of Oak are stalwart and silent. They listen to the world around them and calculate their next action. A follower may be slow to act, but when they make their move, they do it with conviction. He protects others, shielding small plants and moss from the elements. Strong shields, buildings and ships are made from Oak. Followers protect anyone they have agreed to defend steadfastly, even unto death.

**Advantages**

**All**: +1 dice pool bonus to Damage Resistance Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus for summoning spirits of earth or plant spirits (choose 1 when selecting this mentor spirit)

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Stillness for free.

**Disadvantages**

Must have a natural (meaning unaugmented) Body and Strength of 4 or greater to select this mentor spirit.
#### **Rat**
Rat is found wherever humans and the things they discard are, for what other bounty can sustain him? Rat is a scavenger, a stealthy thief who takes what he needs to survive. He dislikes working out in the open, preferring to stick to the shadows. Rat avoids fights whenever he can – when he must fight, he fights to kill quickly and move on.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Stealth Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Alchemy Tests when harvesting reagents and you may use reagents from other traditions

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Natural Immunity

**Disadvantages**

You must make a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test to not immediately flee or seek cover whenever caught in a combat situation. If there is nowhere to flee, they are forced to fight.
#### **Raven**
Raven is a harbinger of trouble in cultures worldwide. He is a trickster and a transformer, dark and devious. Raven thrives off the bounty of carnage and chaos but does not cause them – he merely knows an opportunity when he sees one. Raven loves to eat and rarely refuses an offer of food.

Raven is cousin to Coyote, who shares trickster inclinations with Raven but lacks his darkness and propensity for carnage.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Con Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Manipulation spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: Free Traceless Walk and 1 level of Voice Control

**Disadvantages**

You must make a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test to avoid exploiting someone else’s misfortune to your own advantage or to pull a clever trick or prank even if it’s to the disadvantage of your friends.
#### **Spider**
Spider is one of the more feared and despised totems in the Sixth World. The threat posed by insect spirits is never far from the world’s consciousness and most metahumans still group spiders together with insects (although they are arachnids, scientifically speaking). But the fear of spiders goes deeper than that. Metahumanity has an almost biological fear of spiders, and for good evolutionary reasons, but that isn’t all Spider is. As many cultures know, Spider is not just one thing.

Also known as Anansi, Iktomi or Grandfather Spider, this totem has adapted quite well to the Sixth World. In regions across the globe, Spider presents as a trickster, schemer and hunter. Followers of Spider embody all of these traits and see Spider not as a boogeyman, but as a wise and powerful patron.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Stealth Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Manipulation spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 2 free levels of Spirit Claw (although, in this case it manifests as a fang).

**Disadvantages**

Spider followers, like their mentor, become anxious when events happen beyond their control. As such, they go to great lengths to limit the randomness of their encounters. When not following a plan or a plan doesn’t go according to plan, followers of Spider must pass a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test or suffer -2 to all rolls until a new plan is established.
#### **Wise Warrior**
The Wise Warrior is skilled in the art of war, for battle is an art to them, an exercise in the powers of the mind as well as the body. They study the tactics of their foes and overcome them through a combination of superior strategy and battle prowess. The Wise Warrior does not act out of savagery or battle-lust, but from a position of knowledge and wisdom. Wise Warriors must follow the warrior’s code of honour and conduct themselves properly or risk the loss of favour.

**Advantages**

**All**: +2 dice pool bonus to Leadership Tests

**Magician**: +2 dice pool bonus to Combat spells, preparations and rituals

**Adept**: 1 free level of Improved Ability on a Combat Skill

**Disadvantages**

If you act dishonourably or without courtesy, whether by choice or by accident, you take a -1 dice pool penalty to all actions until you atone for your behaviour.


**<a name="_toc218024808"></a>FOCI**\

====================================
Foci are more than mundane items with a dusting of mana to give them potency. They are astral constructs embedded within physical objects. When active, the design of the astral construct enhances mana energy so that the magician it is bonded to can draw upon it for a specific magical task. The physical form of a focus varies – amulets, belts, wands, walking sticks, cups, daggers, hip flasks, pens and so on and so forth – although most of the time a focus reflects the tradition of its maker. Foci have a Force Rating that measures their power.

You can’t use a focus unless you’ve bonded it to yourself (and you can’t bond foci unless you’re Awakened). Bonding a focus takes an hour per Force of the Focus, spent contemplating the object and synchronising its astral signature to yours. A focus can only be bound to one person at a time – the bonding process breaks the bond with the focus’s previous owner (if it had one).

` `Each focus has a specific power and must be active for you to use it. Activating a focus is a Simple Action. For a focus to remain active, it must be in the possession of the magician (worn, carried, hand-held, in a pocket or pouch, etc). Likewise, if you lose consciousness your foci deactivate. If you lose possession of a focus, it automatically deactivates and you lose all its benefits until you recover it and activate it again. You can deactivate a focus at any time with a Bonus Action.

All foci have auras that are visible from astral space and carry your astral signature. While activated, a focus also has an astral form. If you use astral projection, you also carry the astral form of any active foci you have. If you deactivate a focus while you’re projecting, its astral form disappears and you’ll need to go back to your body to reactivate it.

You can’t bond more foci that your Magic attribute and the maximum Force of all your bonded foci can’t exceed your Magic x5. Regardless of the number of bonded foci you have, only one focus may add its Force to a dice pool for any given test.

|**Focus Item**|**Bonding Cost (Karma)**|
| :- | :- |
|**Enchanting Focus**|Force x3|
|**Metamagic Focus**|Force x3|
|**Power Focus**|Force x6|
|**Qi Focus**|Force x2|
|**Spell Focus**|Force x2|
|**Spirit Focus**|Force x2|
|**Weapon Focus**|Force x3|
### **Focus Types**
There are several categories of foci: Enchanting, Power, Qi, Spirit, Sorcery and Weapon.
#### **Enchanting Foci**
**Alchemical**: An alchemical focus adds its Force in dice to any Alchemical Tests.

**Artificing**: An artificing focus adds its Force in dice to any Artificing Tests.

**Disenchanting**: When a disenchanting focus is in contact with another artifact, the magician can add dice equal to its Force to the Disenchanting Test.
#### **Power Foci**
Power foci temporarily increase your dice pools when using Sorcery, Conjuring or Enchanting.

**Conjuring**: A conjuring focus adds dice equal to its Force to Banishing, Binding and Summoning Tests.

**Enchanting**: An enchanting focus adds dice equal to its Force to Alchemy, Artificing and Disenchanting Tests.

**Sorcery**: A sorcery focus adds dice equal to its Force to Counterspelling, Ritual Magic and Spellcasting Tests.
#### **Qi Foci**
Qi foci only work for adepts. They channel mana into your adept powers. A qi focus can be an object, like other foci, but can also be worked into a body modification, like tattoos, ritual scarring and piercings. Each focus is specific to a single adept power at a specific level. While the focus is active, you get the power contained in it, or if you already have the power, the focus’s levels are added to your own (if it’s a power with levels).
#### **Spirit Foci**
Spirit foci empower a magician’s conjuring skills. Each spirit focus must be attuned to a specific type of spirit.

**Summoning**: A summoning focus adds dice equal to its Force to summoning attempts as long as the targeted spirit is in the same category as the focus.

**Banishing**: The banishing focus adds its Force to the limit of a magician’s Banishing Test as long as the target spirit is in the same category as the focus.

**Binding**: A binding focus helps a magician tie a spirit to them. The focus adds its Force in dice to the magician’s Binding Test as long as the spirit is in the same category as the focus.
#### **Sorcery Foci**
Sorcery foci empower a magician’s sorcery skills. Each sorcery focus must be attuned to a specific category of magic. 

**Counterspelling**: A counterspelling focus adds dice equal to its Force to counterspelling attempts as long as the category of magic is the same category as the focus.

**Ritual Magic**: A ritual magic focus adds dice equal to its Force to Ritual Magic Tests as long as the category of magic is the same category as the focus.

**Spellcasting**: A spellcasting focus adds dice equal to its Force to Spellcasting Tests as long as the category of magic is the same category as the focus.
#### **Weapon Foci**
A weapon focus always has, unsurprisingly, the form of a melee weapon. It adds magical power to the melee attacks you make with it. When used in physical combat, it gives you its Force as a dice pool bonus on your melee Attack Test. You still rely on your Physical Attributes and skills in combat; the weapon focus merely makes you more effective.

A weapon focus is effective against astral forms too, whether you’re using astral perception or projection. It adds its Force to your Astral Combat Tests when you’re using it and you can take it along while astrally projecting. The damage of the weapon in astral combat is the same as it is in the physical world, except that you can decide between Stun or Physical damage.


**<a name="_toc218024809"></a>THE MATRIX**\

==========================================
### **What is the Matrix?**
We use it every day to read out email, pay our bills, talk to our friends and loved ones. It monitors our money, handles our utilities and manages the traffic on our streets. Billons of people use it constantly, from the hungry family in Redmond to the CEO in Neo-Tokyo and everyone in between. It is the Matrix, the digital world within a world made of fibre-optic cables, networks and more data and computing power than has ever existed in the history of the planet. A record that exists today so it can be broken tomorrow.
### **Wireless World**
The paradox of the Matrix is this: to be an ace hacker, you need to understand it – but no one really understands it. Like so many things, though, the real key is to know more and be better than the next guy. So, let’s get you started with a quick overview of the Matrix experience.
### **The Local Mesh**
This is the part of the Matrix that relies on device-to-device connections and is called the **local mesh** or sometimes the **lower grid**. The extreme density of devices in a 2075 city, combined with the ability to seamlessly pass traffic from device to device, can get your signal where it needs to go. The local mesh has a strictly limited range: too many hops, too much distance or too much interference and the signal degrades and becomes useless. Fortunately, for a legitimate user, their network traffic only needs to reach an **uplink node**, so this is rarely an issue. Any two or more Matrix devices within range of each other can form a local mesh, even if they cannot route a signal out to the wider Matrix. They will still be able to communicate with themselves as normal.
### **Uplink Nodes**
When you want to communicate with a device that’s outside local mesh range, first you need an **uplink node**. These are scattered around major metropolitan areas. Your device sends traffic along the local mesh until it reaches the nearest or most convenient uplink node. Uplinks serve as the onramps to the rest of the Matrix; they bridge your traffic over to the backbone. Uplink nodes are sometimes called beanstalks by deckers, because they lead to the clouds.
### **The Backbone**
The **backbone** or the **upper grid**, is the planet-sized interconnected network of fibre cables, satellites, microwave and visible-laser point-to-point communications and other bleeding-edge-tech ways of getting 1s and 0s from A to B. Once your traffic is on the backbone, distance is no object and bandwidth is functionally infinite. Security on uplink nodes is fierce and traffic on the backbone is routinely subjected to deep packet inspection.
### **Commlinks**
Commlinks are the most visible part of the Matrix – the device most commonly associated with it in people’s minds. They are analogous to modern-day smartphones and often take the form of a pocket-sized slab covered in a touchscreen (although they can be much smaller if the user forgoes the screen).

Most people using a commlink do so via a **direct neural interface** (DNI) and **augmented reality** (AR).

DNI gives the user a limited amount of mental control directly over the device, without needing to look at the device or push any buttons. DNI is not telepathy. The user can issue simple on/off, less/more, scroll up/down type commands but not much that is more complicated than that. They can also dictate text but only at the speed that is a few times faster than talking. DNI is tiring to use for long period, as it requires close concentration of a particular kind for the machine to detect the commands. It’s like maintaining a fully spoken inner monologue. Few people can keep that up all day long.

AR means the commlink’s output – mostly visual and audio, some tactile – is projected directly into the user’s consciousness. They see pop-up windows floating in their vision, hear sounds overlaid with the real world, feel the weight and texture of virtual “objects” they touch. Each distinct element of an augmented reality user interface is called an **augmented reality object** (ARO), pronounced “arrow”. AROs can come from your commlink itself, like a messaging window for a control palette. They can be broadcast from nearby devices, like a restaurant displaying a holographic menu outside its door or a friend showing you a selfie they took. Or they can be sent to you from items you are carrying, such as a smartgun displaying remaining ammunition count in a discreet window in the corner of your eye. Because pure DNI control requires mental effort, less hardcore users sometimes fall back to either physical controls or (more often) AROs displaying control surfaces. These are less tiring and can be more precise when very delicate control is needed. User interface AROs accessed via DNI have a tactile component, so the user feels like they are interacting with real physical objects that have weight, texture and temperature.
### **PANs**
Most individuals have multiple electronic devices on them at once and having icons for each one show up would provide too much visual clutter in the Matrix. Often, what shows up instead is an icon representing an individual’s personal area network. This icon often looks similar to the physical device that serves as master for the network, such as a commlink or cyberdeck, but individuals will sometimes choose a design or logo that means something to them (such as sports team logos, Concrete Dreams album covers or corporate designs). Some devices are not merged into the single **PAN** icon; if an individual is carrying a wireless-enabled gun – or another wireless device that might kill you – if may show up separately so that it can be identified rapidly. Unless, of course, the user has gone to the trouble to hide that icon, but that’ll be covered later.

Devices can be slaved to a commlink or cyberdeck. The group consisting of slaved devices plus the master commlink or cyberdeck is called a personal area network, or PAN.


**<a name="_toc218024810"></a>WIRELESS DEVICES**\

================================================
Wireless devices are rated for their power and efficiency based on a number of factors and well as having information about their current use status. Below are the ratings and statuses that a wireless device may have.

**Device Rating**: The device rating is a generic rating for standard devices that don’t have more detailed ratings listed.

**Response**: Response is the processing power and speed of the device’s hardware. Response is used for Matrix Initiative. Response is negatively affected when you run too many programs.

**Signal**: Signal represents the broadcasting power of the device’s hardware. The higher the Signal, the farther the device can transmit and the more signal-noise it can cut through.

**Firewall**: Firewall is the device’s built-in security software. It protects against unauthorised access and fends off hostile access attempts and exploits. Firewall is also used to defend against Matrix attacks in cybercombat.

**System**: System measures the power of the device’s operating system (OS) software. This includes its stability, multitasking properties, ability to control hardware, resources and the general quality of its code. If the System software ever crashes, the entire device crashes. System limits the rating of programs running on the device and sets the limit on most devices for the number of programs that can be run without a Response drop. The System program is limited by the base Response rating of the device it is on: if the base Response rating of the device is lower than the System rating, then the System rating runs equal to the Response rating. System also sets the size of the Matrix Condition Monitor of persona programs running on the device.

**Processor Limit**: Every device has a processor limit, the number of programs loaded and/or slaved devices at which its Response starts to degrade. At every multiple of the System beyond the initial Processor Limit, a device’s Response is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0.

**Active Programs**: The number of programs that can be run simultaneously.

**Device Modes**: Active, Passive and Hidden.
#### **User Modes Table**

|**User Mode**|**Initiative**|**Initiative Dice**|**Notes**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Augmented Reality**|Physical Initiative|Physical Initiative Dice|Can be distracting|
|**Cold-Sim**|Response + Intuition|3D6|-|
|**Hot-Sim**|Response + Intuition|4D6|+2 bonus to Matrix actions|

#### **Matrix Condition Monitor**
The Matrix Condition Monitor measures the amount of Matrix damage an icon can take. It typically has a number of boxes equal to 8 + (System / 2, rounded up). An icon crashes when all the boxes on its Matrix Condition Monitor are filled. If your persona icon crashes, you are immediately disconnected from the Matrix, as with the Jack Out action. If you were operating in VR, you suffer dumpshock when this happens.
#### **Noise**
Noise is the static of the wireless Matrix. There are a lot of things than can mess with your signal, like nearby electronics, natural and artificial dampening and even cosmic background radiation. It may seem as if traffic in the Matrix is instantaneous, but ask anyone who has played an online game with someone a few continents away – there is a noticeable delay when compared to playing someone next door. When decisions are being made in the blink of an eye, every speed difference matters. The farther you are away from an icon in real life, the harder it is to communicate with it, whether your intentions are harmful or benign.

The most common source of noise is distance from your target, but there are other causes. There are also spam zones and static zones to deal with. A spam zone has so much traffic (often commercial in nature) that everything gets processed slower. Static zones are areas with either a lot of electromagnetic blockage (like an underground tunnel, labyrinth of sewer or ruins of a steel office building) or far away from civilisation.
#### **Signal Rating Table**

|**Rating**|**Range**|**Examples**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**0**|2 m|Nanoware transceivers, cyberware, intra-PAN devices|
|**1**|40 m|RFID tags, handheld electronics|
|**2**|100 m|Headware transceivers, micro-drone sensors|
|**3**|400 m|Average commlinks, residential/small business wi-fi routers, vehicular autonav sensors|
|**4**|1 km|Crawler-drone sensors|
|**5**|4 km|Cyberlimb transceivers, heavy drone surveillance sensors|
|**6**|10 km|Mobile-phone towers, public access wi-fi routers|
|**7**|40 km|Targeting sensors for ground vehicle weapons|
|**8**|100 km|Flight radar, dedicated ground surveillance radar|
|**9**|400 km|Maritime/naval radar, commercial AM/FM radio|
### **Device Modes**
Devices can run in one of three modes: Active, Passive and Hidden. You can change the mode of your commlink (and the rest of your PAN) as a Bonus Action.

**Active Mode**: Active mode is the default for most PANs. In Active mode, you can both access and be accessed by other PANs, devices and networks. You give permission for anyone to connect to your commlink and see your profile (read only, unless you choose otherwise). Certain areas may require your PAN to be in active mode, like airports, corp facilities, major metropolitan centres, etc. Your public profile is visible and available.

**Passive Mode**: A PAN in Passive mode can be “seen” by other devices, but cannot be accessed by them without your approval. PANs in this mode will still show up as active networks. This mode is useful for operating in high-traffic areas, where advertising nets or spammers abound. Passive mode allows you to automatically filter out the noise, only alerting you if specific pre-authorised nodes request access. This is the default mode for peripheral nodes and nexi.

**Hidden Mode**: In Hidden mode, your commlink and PAN are invisible to other nodes unless you access or authorise them. Users in hidden mode are said to be “ghosting”, since there is no way for other users to see them wirelessly. Using hidden mode is discouraged in some high-class social situations where it is considered rude. In other areas, particularly tech-free zones or shadow establishments where privacy is expected, the opposite is true. Certain secure areas and high-class establishments prohibit users from operating in hidden mode and will punish those doing so with expulsion, arrest or worse.

While in Hidden Mode, you suffer a -2 dice pool penalty on all Matrix actions due to the processing power needed to cover your tracks.
### <a name="_hlk205062386"></a>**Matrix <a name="_hlk205062380"></a>Actions for the Non-Hacker**
**Log On**: Simple Action. No Test. You access a node and your icon (persona) appears there. This requires no test, as long as you have proper authentication to an account (such as a passcode) or a hacked account. It should go without saying, but you also need a connection to the node’s device, either with a wired connection or a wireless connection. You can’t log on if have no way to get online.

**Switch to AR/VR**: Simple Action. You switch your perception from AR to VR or vice versa. Not that switching to VR causes your body to go limp, so do not do so in dangerous places. If you switch from VR to AR, you might lose Initiative.

**Send Message**: Bonus Action. No Test. You send a text or audio message the length of a short sentence, an image or a file via the Matrix to a use whose commcode you have. If you’re using the Matrix through a DNI, you can send longer and more complicated messages. You can also use this action to open a live feed to one or more recipients, using and digital recording devices you have.

**Matrix Search**: Extended Action. Computer + Intuition [Browse Program Rating] (\*). You search the Matrix for information about a topic. The time it takes and the threshold of the test depend on the general availability of the information in question and the area being searched, respectively. Any hits above and beyond the threshold can be used to reduce the search time. Divide the base time by the net hits to determine the reduction. If you fail this test, you still spend the full base time looking.

Some information is protected and kept secret, stored in a host that is not publicly accessible. Finding this information usually requires you to find and enter the hosts in which the data is hidden.

**Matrix Perception**: Simple Action. Computer + Intuition [Analyse Program Rating]. You hits determine how successful the examination is. If your target is running a Stealth program, it becomes an Opposed Test, with the target rolling Logic + Electronic Warfare (+Stealth program rating) (or Firewall + Stealth for devices or nodes) as the opposing dice pool. The hits from this test reduce your hits and consequently the amount of information you gather. If you garner no net hits, the target’s icon has melded into the background of data traffic, escaping your notice.

You may also use Matrix Perception to determine whether someone has tapped Matrix traffic through the node or to detect some of the tricks that sprites can perform.

**Control Device**: Complex Action. No Test. You control a device through the Matrix, using your Command Program like a remote control or video game controller. This can be used in a variety of ways from commanding your soykaf machine to start brewing a pot before you get out of bed to firing a drone-mounted rifle. The complexity of the device you can control and the complexity of the commands you send are limited by your Command program rating. In the hierarchy of control, this is Remote Control. If it isn’t your device, you need to gain access permissions first.

**Run Program**: Complex Action. You run a program that is loaded in a device to which you have access and the appropriate privileges. This changes the program’s status from loaded to running. Programs must be running in order to be used.

**Deactivate Program**: Simple Action. You switch a program’s status from running to loaded.

**Edit File**: Variable Action. Computer + Logic [Edit Program Rating]. The threshold is based on the extent, quality and complexity of the edits being made. Continuous editing of a device’s output requires the expenditure of a Simple Action every Initiative Phase for the duration. Edit allows you to create, change or delete files. A Complex Action is required to alter one detail of a file: about a sentence of text or a detail of an image or about a second of video or audio.

**Encrypt**: Complex Action. Software + Logic [Encrypt Program Rating]. You encrypt a file, set of files, node or communication link. You also choose a passcode that you or another user can use to decrypt the file.

**Decrypt**: Complex Action. If you have the key to a particular encryption, you decrypt it with this action. If you use this on a file, the file becomes decrypted.

**Transfer Data**: Simple Action. No Test. You transfer a file or set of files from one node to another. Most transfers last until the end of the current Combat Turn; the connection speeds of the Matrix are fast enough that only files of epic size take longer than normal.

**Terminate Data Transfer**: Bonus Action. You terminate a data transfer you initiated.

**Log Off**: Simple Action. You log off the node and close your connection to a host.

**Reboot**: Complex Action. You initiate a reboot of a device you have appropriate privileges to do so (often an admin account). All programs stop running and all subscriptions are terminated and anyone who is still running their persona on the device is severed from the Matrix, suffering dumpshock if they are in VR.

**DECKING**\

===========
A decker is someone who uses a cyberdeck (hence the name) to break the rules of the Matrix. A cyberdeck – usually just called a deck – is like a commlink with some extra features. It is a bit bigger than a commlink, about the size of a small tablet or a spiral-bound notebook. Its specialised functions are questionable legality make it far more expensive than ordinary commlinks. The cyberdeck has advanced electronics and firmware based on reverse-engineered protocols used in Matrix security. In a short, a cyberdeck is the tool you need to be a decker.

A deck can perform all the functions of a commlink, but its primary purpose is hacking in the Matrix. Cyberdecks have a built-in sim module because they are so often used in VR, so a decker only needs a datajack or other DNI device to make that connection, instead of needing the full sim implant.

Deckers are far and away the most common type of hacker. They come to a profession out of necessity, a desire for profit or a sense of mischief: or all three. They are heavily dependent on their skills and they need good gear to make sure their skills shine. They can usually maintain and even build their own electronic devices.
### **Matrix Actions for the Decker**
**Masked Access**: Complex Action. Hacking + Logic [Exploit Program Rating] v Intuition + Firewall. You falsify account details to log on without real access permissions. You access a node and your icon (persona) appears there. On a failure, the target’s alert level is raised and you are spotted.

**Force Access**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Exploit Program Rating] v Willpower + Firewall. You make a brute force attack to log on without real access permissions. You access a node and your icon (persona) appears there. The target’s alert level is raised and you are spotted. If you wish, you may also inflict 1 DV of Matrix damage to the target for every two full net hits, if the target can take Matrix damage, which is resisted with the target’s Device Rating + Firewall. On a failure, you don’t alert them at all.

**Intercept Traffic**: Complex Action. Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Snoop Program Rating] (3). You eavesdrop traffic between two nodes. To do this, you must have access to a node through which the traffic passes. This action is only effective in a wired network. Your net hits are the threshold for others to detect the snooping with a Matrix Perception Test. The traffic may be copied and recorded or forwarded to a third part with no additional tests.

If the traffic is encrypted, you must break the encryption before it can be examined. Once decrypted, if you want to block or alter some of the traffic before sending it along, you must use the Edit action.

To insert fake traffic, you must succeed in an Opposed Test between the Hacking + Logic [Snoop Program Rating] v System + Firewall.

**Squelch**: Simple Action. Electronic Warfare + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Stealth + Intuition. A successful Squelch test prevents the target device from calling or sending messages for a number of Combat Turns equal to the net hits scored. 

**Intercept Wireless Comms**: Complex Action. Electronic Warfare + Intuition [Snoop Program Rating] (3). You eavesdrop on wireless traffic going to and from a device. You must be within the device’s Signal range to capture the traffic. If you succeed on the test, you may copy, record or forward the traffic without another test as long as you remain within the target device’s Signal range and keep the program running. If the comms are encrypted, you must break the encryption before they can be examined.

**Crack Encryption**: Extended Action. Hacking + Logic [Decrypt Program Rating] (Encryption Rating, Variable). You attempt to break down an encryption to which you have access. When you break the encryption, the data becomes decrypted. 

**Corrupt Data**: Extended Action. Hacking + Logic [Corrupt Program Rating] (Variable, Complex Action). The Corrupt Data action unleashes a Corrupt program on a particular file. The program is set to twist and change information. The threshold is based on the complexity of the data, the size of the file and the abundance of the data.

**Spoof Command**: Complex Action. Hacking + Logic [Spoof Program Rating]. You send a command to a device or agent, pretending it is from an authorised source. You must have logged on to a device from which the target accepts commands. If you succeed, the target accepts the command as legitimate. Each Spoof Command action applies only to a single command; multiple commands require multiple Spoof Command attempts. In the hierarchy of control, this is a command to the Autopilot.

**Trace Icon**: Extended Action. Computer + Intuition [Track Program Rating] (10, Complex Action). You trace an icon back to its originating node. When you reach the threshold of the Extended Test, you have successfully traced the target, learning the target’s access ID and the physical location of the device housing the originating node (for example, the user’s commlink). As long as you keep your Track program running and the target remains connected to the Matrix, you may continue to monitor the target’s location.

**Redirect Trace**: Complex Action. Hacking + Intuition [Spoof Program Rating]. The number of net hits are added to the threshold of the Trace Icon Test. You may take this action multiple times against the same target. This action only works against a tracking attempt in progress.

**Jack Out**: Simple Action. You disconnect from your device. In VR, it means removing your connection from your commlink, either by removing trodes, unplugging a datajack or shutting off a neural connection. If you jack out while in VR, you suffer dumpshock.

Note: If you are link-locked, this requires a Hardware + Willpower [Firewall] with a threshold of twice the net hits on the Link-Lock Test.
### **Matrix Combat Actions**
**Attack Device**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Firewall + Firewall [Firewall]. You make an attack against a device in a node where your persona currently exists. If you score more hits that the defender, the attack succeeds – not the net hits. Otherwise, the attack fails.

**Attack Persona**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Intuition + Firewall [Firewall]. You make an attack against a persona in a node where your persona currently exists. If you score more hits that the defender, the attack succeeds – not the net hits. Otherwise, the attack fails.

**Crash Program**: Complex Action. Cybercombat + Logic [Attack Program Rating] v Program Rating + Firewall [Firewall]. You make an attack against a program in a node where your persona currently exists.

**Link-Lock**: Complex Action. Computer + Logic [Lockdown Program Rating] v Intuition + Firewall [Firewall]. This program sends keep-alive signals to the device that force it to cancel any attempt to leave the Matrix. You prevent a persona from being able to switch interface mode, enter or exit the node, reboot their device or log off until you stop running the Lockdown program or they successfully Jack Out. The net hits become the threshold for Jacking Out.

**Repair Icon**: Extended Action. Software + Logic [Medic Program Rating] (Damage Taken x2, Complex Action). When the threshold is reached, all damage is removed from the target icon. Note that it is possible for the threshold to change during the Extended Test if the icon suffers further damage. This action only repairs Matrix Damage.
### **Programs**
In order to interact with the Matrix, you need to use programs. Programs can be purchased (or written by a hacker) and then stored with a cyberdeck or commlink. A program that is stored is loaded into the device. This is analogous to wearing a holstered weapon or putting a tool in your pocket; a loaded program is being carried for later use.

In order to use a program, it must be running. A running program is executed by the device on which your persona is running and belongs to your persona; only you may use the program.
### **Common Use Programs**
Common use programs are widespread and legal throughout the Matrix.

**Analyse**: Analyse programs gather data about icons and nodes in the Matrix by issuing queries, analysing system resources, performing registry lookups and so on.

*This program, when active, enables the Matrix Perception action.*

**Browse**: Browse programs are specialised search routines that help track down information on a particular node or in the Matrix at large.

*This program, when active, enables the Matrix Search action.*

**Command**: Command programs give the user a modular and customisable control interface for various devices. The allows the user to control a device through the Matrix.

*This program, when active, enables the Control Device action.*

**Edit**: Edit is a combination word processor, graphic design tool and video/animation editor. You can use it to create and alter files of any media type: text, graphics, video, trideo, simsense, etc. Edit sees common usage in the corporate world but hackers use it for their own subversive ends.

*This program, when active, enables the Edit File action.*
### **Hacking Programs**
The following programs are generally only used by hackers and security specialists. In most jurisdictions, these programs are illegal without proper licencing. Hackers use these programs to exploit security flaws and attack icons.

**Armour**: Armour programs are software redundancy and automatic backup systems that protect personas from attacks that cause Matrix Damage.

*This program, when active, adds the Armour Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Damage.*

**Attack**: Attack programs are hostile code carriers that attempt to kill processes, introduce random input, create program faults and otherwise try to crash a program, persona or device.

*This program, when active, enables the Attack Device, Attack Persona and Crash Program action.*

**Biofeedback Filter**: Biofeedback filters are software routines that monitor simsense signals and filter harmful feedback. Hackers specifically use biofeedback filters against attack programs in cybercombat and against dumpshock.

*This program, when active, adds the Biofeedback Filter Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Biofeedback Damage and Dumpshock Damage.*

**Corrupt**: A mix of Edit and Browse subroutines, Corrupt programs are designed to track down and demolish specific information in a node without actually deleting the files in which they are saved. The idea is that, since deleted files can be restored from back-ups, Corrupt edits the files to overwrite the targeted information while leaving the file intact, without making any indication of the alteration, so that the corrupted file is eventually backed up as well, making detection and recovery of the original more difficult.

*This program, when active, enables the Corrupt Data action.*

**Decrypt**: Decrypt programs are designed to conduct a number of cipher-busting attacks – from pattern analysis to brute-force dictionary assaults to sophisticated mathematical tricks – to break into an encrypted system or service.

*This program, when active, enables the Crack File Protection action.*

**Evade**: Evasion programs hinder attack programs from successfully affecting your persona.

*This program, when active, adds the Evasion Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Attacks.*

**Exploit**: Exploit programs are constantly evolving hacker tools specifically designed to take advantage of security flaws and weaknesses so that a hacker can gain unauthorised access to a node or program.

*This program, when active, enables the Masked Access action.*

**Lockdown**: The lockdown program is used to link-lock a persona until you stop running this program or they successfully Jack Out.

*This program, when active, enables the Link-Lock action.*

**Medic**: Use Medic programs to repair Matrix damage inflicted on Personas and Devices. Though legitimate users sometimes use Medic programs to fix corrupted files, misbehaving programs and other errors, hackers use Medic to keep functioning after a bout of cybercombat.

*This program, when active, enables the Repair Icon action.*

**Snoop**: Snoop programs gather data traffic and wireless signals and capture the information. Snoop programs are the ultimate Matrix spying utility.

*This program when active, enables the Intercept Wireless Comms and Intercept Traffic actions.*

**Spoof**: You can use Spoof programs to generate false access IDs and forge misleading data packets with the intent of confusing Track programs.

*This program, when active, enables the Redirect Trace and Spoof Command actions.*

**Stealth**: Stealth is a clever hacker program that attempts to hide the hacker from other system processes. While it cannot make an icon completely undetectable, it makes the hacker seem innocuous by obfuscating their activities, erasing system tracks and mimicking authorised traffic. While it is not used for any action, Stealth hides the hacker from detection by the Firewall as they break into a system, as well as from Matrix Perception tests and Trace User attempts.

*This program, when active, adds the Stealth Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Perception.*

**Track**: Track programs systematically analyse a user’s connection and follow the data trail back to the originating node. Track is commonly used as an intrusion countermeasure with the intent of identifying and locating a hacker or launching a counterattack, but it is also used to keep tabs on automated taxis and emergency service calls.

*This program, when active, enables the Trace Icon action and adds the Track Program’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to opposed Matrix Perception Tests made to detect personas.*


**<a name="_toc218024811"></a>RIGGING**\

=======================================
### **Being the Machine**
Rigging starts with the important first step of having a control rig augmentation for your character. That’s only the starting point, though – there’s a lot more to being a rigger than just having a rig. Like everything on the street, it’s also about your skills. And then, the most SOTA rig and the best skills still won’t mean squat without something to take control of and that means a vehicle or a drone. Or several drones, in which case you’re going to want a rigger command console (RCC). No one ever said being this cool was gonna be cheap.

Every control rig needs a rigger interface. The rigger interface is specialised gear that is fitted to a vehicle and allows you to jump in, rigger-style. Drones are designed for use by riggers and have been designed with the rigger interface built in. Nearly all vehicles need to have the interface added as an after-factory option, however, except for military and law-enforcement vehicles.
### **The Control Rig**
The control rig implant connects to a lot of different areas of your brain. It uses your motor cortex, of course, along with parts of your cerebrum, brain stem and the sensorium, with a few tendrils snaking around your pre-frontal and frontal cortices. A control rig is required for rigging.
### **Complete Control**
Vehicles and other devices (like doors, trid-sets and so on) can be controlled in four ways.

- - Autopilot requires that the device have a pilot program, which most vehicles and drones do.
- - Manual control requires actual physical controls, like a steering wheel, throttle, buttons, an AR display or anything else a person can manipulate to control the device.
- - Remote control is the result of the Control Device action
- - Rigger control is the result of jumping into the device.
### **Control Override**
A device can only be controlled one way at a time. You can’t, for example, have a person manually firing a turret at the same time you’re firing the same turret to get extra shots. Some control methods can be overridden by other methods and the highest in this order controls the device. At the top of the order is rigger control, followed by remote control, then manual control and lastly autopilot. You can override someone else’s control on a device by using a method that comes in higher on that list, so if you issue a command through a control rig, attempts to manoeuvre at the same time using a remote control or manual control will be overridden. Once a device’s control is overridden, it cannot be controlled by a method equal to or lower that it in the order until the Initiative Pass after the current controller relinquishes control (voluntarily… or not).
### **Rigging and You**
Riggers have a special set of rules when they’re jumped in. This makes them more powerful, but also exposes them to more risks. Here’s the skinny on all of the specialness you’ll have as a rigger in the Sixth World.
### **Rigging Security Systems**
It is possible for the devices in a security system (cameras, maglocked doors, laser tripwires, fixed gun-drones and other sensors and sec-measures) to be rigger adapted and subscribed to a central node so that a rigger can “jump in” the entire security system. Security riggers feel the opening of doors as light touches on their skin, the tripping of alarm sensors as a buzz in their fingers or an itch and the building’s alarm literally goes off in their heads.
### **Jumping In**
**Direct Connection**: A direct connection requires you have a control rig and device (vehicle, security system, drone) that has a rigger interface.

If you’re using a direct connection and already plugged into the vehicle or RCC, you can jump in from your meat body with a Simple Action. If you’re using a direct connection, you don’t have to worry about Noise at all. A rigger’s data cable gets a lot of use for this reason. When jumped in, you’re in VR mode.

**Jump Into Rigged Device**: Simple Action if using a direction connection. Otherwise, Complex Action. Electronic Warfare + Logic [Command] v Willpower + Firewall [Firewall]. You jump into a device that has a rigger adaptation, usually a vehicle, drone or security system. This action requires that you have a control rig and to be in VR mode. Additionally, you must have the appropriate access level to the device (whether through ownership, invite or hacking).

**VR and Rigging**: Just like in the Matrix, you have the option of using cold-sim or hot-sim while rigging. If you’re using cold-sim, you get +2D6 to your Initiative (3D6 total) and any biofeedback damage you take is Stun. If you’re using hot-sim, you get +3D6 (4D6 total) Initiative dice and a +1 dice pool bonus that applies to all Matrix tests (including Vehicle actions), but all biofeedback damage is Physical damage.

**Rigging Limits**: When you’re jumped into a vehicle, drone or other device, the limits of that device are increased by the rating of your control rig. This includes vehicle and drone Sensor, Acceleration and Handling and the Accuracy of mounted weapons when used by the rigger.

**Physical Damage**: Whenever the vehicle or other device you’re jumped into takes Physical damage, the feedback can hurt you. Whenever the vehicle or drone you’re jumped into takes boxes of damage, you must resist half (rounded up) of that damage as Biofeedback damage.

If the vehicle, drone or device you’re jumped into is destroyed while you’re jumped in, you suffer dump shock (6 DV biofeedback damage).

**Matrix Damage**: When you take Matrix damage, it goes to the first device you’re using for your persona, not the device you’re jumped into. If you used your commlink or rigger command console to enter VR before jumping in, your commlink or RCC (respectively) is the target of Matrix damage to your persona.
### **Jumping Out**
**Jump to VR**: You can jump out of a device and go to VR as a Simple Action.

**Jump to AR**: You can jump out of a device and go to AR as a Complex Action.
### **Rigger Command Console (RCC)**
Along with the standard features of a commlink, rigger command consoles have Noise Reduction and Sharing Ratings. The Noise Reduction rating is straight-up Noise Reduction, which is cumulative with most other forms of Noise Reduction. The Sharing Rating is the number of autosofts you can run on the RCC that simultaneously run on all slaved devices at the same time. One caveat: if a system is running any of its own autosofts, it cannot benefit from the RCC’s autosofts.

Rigger command consoles have the familiar Response, Signal, System and Firewall ratings, similar to cyberdecks, but they lean towards boosted Signal and System Ratings in their functionality. Firewall is used to defend against unwanted wireless intrusion onto the entire system network.

Your RCC manages several parallel connections at once, so you can give a command to one, all or some of your slaved devices with the same Simple Action. This multi-connection also lets you jump from one slaved device to another without first jumping out of the device you’re leaving. Commands issued from your RCC are acted on during your device’s Action Phase, not yours.

Devices receiving multiple contradicting commands on the same control levels before they have a chance to enact those commands on their Action Phase tend to fail to perform any of them and instead send an error message back to the users attempting to issue the commands.
### **PANs & WANs**
If you want extra protection for your devices and ability to command groups of the same type at once, you must slave them to your RCC. Your RCC can handle up to (System x3) slaved devices, becoming the master device on that network. The group of your slaved devices plus your master RCC is called a **personal area network** or PAN.

Whenever a slaved device needs to make a Defence Test, it uses either its own or its master’s Rating for each Rating in the Test.

There are also **wide area networks** or WANs, with multiple devices slaved to a host. This is the world of that special kind or rigger, the security spider. They slave their RCC to the building’s host and connect to the entire security system, including all of its slaved drones. The spider-rigger is often teamed up with a spider-decker to help against hacking intrusions on the security system.


**<a name="_toc218024812"></a>DRONES**\

======================================
Drones are unmanned vehicles intended to be used remotely by riggers or run autonomously. Of course, any vehicle or other machine with a rigger interface can be run remotely by riggers or autonomously, but drones tend to be cheaper, more specialised to their function and don’t need to pay for parking. Still, the rules for drones apply to any remotely controlled or rigged device but, between us chummers, let’s just say “drone” because it’s shorter.
### **Drones in the Matrix**
Drones are devices, so they show up in the Matrix. This can make them a target for enemy hackers but it also means you can reach your drone from anywhere on the planet. If you’re jumped into a drone, the drone’s Matrix icon and your device’s icon merge. When jumped into a drone (or any vehicle for that matter) the attacker can only target you (your persona and the device it’s on) and not your drone. When you’re not jumped in, you drone becomes a valid target once again.

The default Device Rating of a drone is the same as its Pilot Rating.

**Drone Initiative**: Drones acting autonomously have an Initiative attribute of Device Rating x2 and get a total of 4D6 Initiative Dice. When jumped in, the drone uses the VR initiative of the rigger.

**Drone Perception**: A drone observes its surroundings with a Pilot + Clearsight [Sensor] Test. If you’re jumped into the drone, you make a Perception + Intuition [Sensor] Test. Either way, you get to use the drone’s entire sensor suite, if it has one.

**Drone Infiltration**: Drones sometimes need to be sneaky. When this occurs, a few things need to be taken into consideration. When operating independently, drones roll Pilot + Stealth [Handling] v Perception + Intuition [Mental]. You might want to put your drone into **Hidden Mode** or its Matrix icon would be a dead giveaway of their presence to anyone scanning the scene in the Matrix. When jumped in, the test is Stealth + Intuition [Handling] v Perception + Intuition [Mental]; you probably want your persona operating under **Hidden Mode** while you’re at it.
### **Pilot Programs**
Pilots (the programs, not the people) are not bright. They’re called “dog-brains” by those who have to work with them, much the same way a particularly thick person might be called a “drone-head” by those who work with them.

A pilot program is specific to the device it’s in. You can’t just copy a program from one device and move it into a different one. After a week or so, the pilot is so adapted to the specific vehicle, drone or other device that it’s useless in anything else, even other devices of the same model.

The Pilot Rating is used in place of any Mental attribute needed for a test but it hardly makes up for a metahuman brain. When faced with something novel or unexpected or a complicated command, a Pilot program must make a Pilot Rating x2 Test against a threshold set up the gamesmaster based on how confusing the situation is. If it fails this test, it blithely continues doing what it was doing before or simply stops entirely and asks for instructions.
### **Autosofts**
Autosofts are specialised programs designed to increase the effectiveness of a drone’s performance. In other words, people have skills, drones have autosofts. An autosoft is rated between 1 and 6. A drone has a number of slots to use for autosofts and cyberprograms listed on their profile. Swapping autosofts and programs is a Complex Matrix Action.

Here’s a short list of autosoft programs. An autosoft with the term [Model] in it means that each copy is for a specific model of drone or vehicle.

**[Model] Clearsight**: This acts as the drone’s Perception skill.

**Electronic Warfare**: Exactly like the Electronic Warfare skill.

**[Model] Evasion**: This autosoft teaches the drones autopilot how to avoid being locked onto by Sensors.

**[Model] Manoeuvring**: This is like a Pilot [Vehicle type] skill, except that it only applies to one specific drone model.

**[Model]** **Stealth**: This autosoft helps a drone of a specific model operate with as much stealth as possible and acts as the Sneaking skill for the drone.

**[Weapon] Targeting**: This is the Gunnery skill but for a weapon of a specific model. If you mount an Ingram Smartgun, you’ll need an Ingram Smartgun Targeting autosoft for it.

If a drone is slaved to a rigger command console and isn’t running any of its own programs, it uses the programs running on the RCC. This can exceed its normal program limit.


**<a name="_toc218024813"></a>TECHNOMANCERS**\

=============================================
Technomancers are metahumans with the mysterious (if not mystical) ability to connect to and manipulate the Matrix without the aid of technology. They not only have this seemingly supernatural aptitude, but they have the ability to do things that no computer can do or *should* be able to do. Scientists and magical researchers haven’t figured out what makes a technomancer tick, but they agree that it isn’t science or magic. As you’d suspect, this makes a lot of people very nervous around technomancers. The fact that a lot of people believe that it might be fun for researchers to cut open a technomancer’s brain to see how it works tends to make technomancers nervous around other people, especially megacorporate Matrix engineers.

Technomancers live in a world filled with the ebb and flow of data. They feel datastreams and empathise with icons. The Matrix is just part of the world they live in, as natural for them as walking is for mundane folks. Even technomancers don’t really know how they do it – they just do it.

With their intuitive grasp of computers and the Matrix, almost all technomancers are wiz programmers. Most employers won’t hire them, though, because the world just doesn’t trust technomancers. In the public view, technomancers are creepy and unnatural. They communicate through the Matrix (*subverting* it, they say) with a thought, so suspicions of a global conspiracy abound. Whenever something goes wrong in the Matrix, especially if there are fatalities, the spectre of the technomancer menace rises again in the media and news outlets. There is still a bounty on technomancers in some territories and technomancy is punishable by death in a handful of places around the world. The end result of this is that technomancers hide their abilities and identities and some even their talent with programming, to avoid harassment and threats.

This is not to say that all technomancers are bad or out to twist the Matrix to their own ends. Most just want to live their lives in peace. Very few are actually hackers and only a few of those are talented enough to be shadowrunners.
### **Technomancer Life**
While deckers might be thought of as scuba divers, using all sorts of gear to dive into and navigate the Matrix, technomancers are more like squid. The Matrix is their native environment and they use it reflexively and instinctually. They don’t have to make sure they’ve got the right gear on them, that it’s turn on, connected and functioning optimally. They want to do something, they dive into the streams surrounding them and do it.

Technomancers pick up the skills to deal with both the physical world and the data that’s constantly flowing through the air around them. They learn how to keep from being overwhelmed in high-traffic areas and how to keep from being withdrawn or depressed in static zones or places with weak coverage. They learn how to make their brains their own operating system and browser combined, an access point they can use to find what they want, all while keeping everything else from getting in and bludgeoning their brains with song lyrics, stock quotes and celebrity gossip. And two million videos of kittens.

What their brains do – and plenty of researchers would love to know how this works – is learn the basic Matrix protocols, so that they can see the icons of the Matrix the way gear-based users see them. It’s like learning a language for them, and once they know it, technomancers have trouble imagining a world without that virtual vocabulary. It lets them see the icons and AROs laid over the world around them and allows them to drop into the trance that is the technomancer version of VR.

Most technomancers say the VR feels more comfortable to them, more “real”. They say that the hard, unmalleable reality of meatspace feels foreign to them. They prefer to be surrounded by things that respond to their desires and commands, things that are reactive and alive with information, not dead and inert like real-world objects.

Technomancers tend to be fluid thinkers, talented analysts or virtuoso programmers. While deckers work with gear, starting with the tool and producing a result, technomancers start with their desire and then devise or summon tools that allow them to do it. They can be very fast, creative and unpredictable. Most non-technomancers find it best to either to have one on their side or never to meet one at all.
### **Resonance**
The **Resonance** is what technomancers use to describe the energy that they feel and manipulate in the Matrix. It consists of data, interactions between data streams, intentions, thoughts… okay, nobody really knows what it’s made of, but to technomancers it’s a real thing they can feel and touch.

If you’re a technomancer, you have a Resonance attribute. This attribute represents how connected you are to the Resonance. Your Resonance rating affects all of your Resonance abilities and your living persona. Your natural Resonance maximum is your Essence rounded down. For every point (or faction thereof) of Essence lost, both your current Resonance Attribute and your maximum Resonance Rating are reduced by one. If your Resonance ever reaches zero, you lose the Technomancer quality and all Resonance abilities.

**Resonance Signatures**: When you use a Resonance ability, you leave a unique signature behind in the fabric of the Resonance. This Resonance signature gets left on the target. If you’re in a host, your signature is left there, too. A signature has a rating equal to the Resonance rating of whatever left it and it lasts for one hour times its rating.

Other Resonance beings (technomancers, sprites and… others) can detect a Resonance signature by getting at least 3 hits on a Matrix Perception Test. If you’ve seen a signature before you may recognise it (perhaps requiring a Memory Test). With 5 or more hits, you also get the impression of what kind of being or ability left it there. You can erase a signature with the Erase Signature action.

Resonance beings have their own signatures (with a rating equal to their Resonance) on themselves all the time. A sprite has the resonance signature of the technomancer that complied it, as do the signatures the sprite leaves.

**Erase Resonance Signature**: Complex Action

**Test**: Computer + Resonance [Resonance] v (2x Signature Rating)

You temporarily conceal the personal signature on yourself (or your sprite) for 1 Combat Turn per hit.
### **Resonance Actions**
Some actions you can perform as a technomancer are Resonance actions. These actions only operate in the Matrix but they’re not Matrix actions and don’t follow those rules. The bad news is that you don’t get the bonus dice for being in VR (those only come with Matrix Actions). Almost all Resonance action cause **fading**, a mental drain on the technomancer.
### **Fading**
Technomancers are powerful, but not inexhaustible. Resonance abilities strain the user, even to the point of collapse if they’re used too much. Technomancers call this drain **Fading**. Fading is resisted with Resonance + Willpower. Fading can only be healed by the body’s natural healing process, which means taking some time to rest.
### **Living Persona**
Technomancers have a **living persona** they use in the Matrix. Your living persona’s icon can be whatever you like, following the rules for persona icons. Since your living persona is just a persona, not a device, you don’t have any onboard storage; this is easy enough to deal with because you can store files in nearby devices.

Your Resonance is your Limit on your Resonance Actions. Your Response attribute is equal to your Intuition. Your Signal attribute is equal to your Charisma. Your System attribute is equal to your Logic. Your Firewall attribute is equal to your Willpower.

As a technomancer, you can only use AR and hot-sim VR (the only time you can use cold-sim VR is by using a cyberdeck or commlink – eww). Since you’re in hot-sim naturally, you may add your Resonance to your dice pool for all Addiction Tests for using hot-sim. Since you’re so intimately connected to the Matrix, you get a +2 dice pool bonus to all Matrix Perception Tests.

You don’t have a separate Matrix Condition Monitor. Instead, any boxes of Matrix damage you would take hit you directly as Stun damage.

**Rebooting Your Living Persona**: You can reboot your living persona, if you want. Really, you’re just shutting yourself off from the Matrix for a time but it operates with the same mechanics as the Reboot Device action (although it doesn’t count as a Matrix action). A lot of technomancers reboot their living persona before they go to sleep, using the reboot delay as a sort of built-in alarm clock; it keeps them safe from cyber-attacks while digital sugarplums dance in their heads.

**Using Mundane Electronics**: You can use a commlink or cyberdeck if you like. A lot of technomancers do in order to hide their abilities. If you use a persona on a device, you can’t use your Resonance abilities. That only works when you’re using your living persona, and since you can only use one persona at a time – well, you get the idea.
### **Threading**
If you ask different technomancers how they perform the Matrix miracles they do, they’ll tell you it’s called **threading** but they won’t agree on how it works. For some it’s a mental exercise. Others just ask the Matrix nicely to do what they want and still others think about different urban brawl plays. However it’s done, it gets results.

You can thread a **complex form**, a specific effect on the Matrix that you have learned to perform. Threading is accomplished with Thread Complex Form, a Resonance action (not a Matrix action). When you thread a complex form, you choose a **level** for the effect. The higher the **level**, the stronger the effect, but also the more risky it is to do. You can choose a **level** up to three times your Resonance rating.
### **Complex Forms**
Threading each Complex Form is a Complex Action.

**Editor**: Target: File	Duration: P	FV: L-1

You infuse a file with Resonance long enough to manipulate its contents. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] test against the Intuition + System of the file’s owner. You can make the same amount of changes to the file that you would be able to make with your net hits in Edit File actions.

**IC Tray**: Target: Host	Duration: I	FV: L-2

This complex form scans the host the technomancer is currently residing in and displays a list of the IC it is currently equipped to deploy, up to the number of hits scored on an Opposed Software + Resonance [Level] v Host Rating + Firewall Test.

**Pulse Storm**: Target: Persona	Duration: I	FV: L-3

You pull signals out of the Resonance and surround the target with them. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] test against Logic + System. For each net hit you get, the target’s Noise is increased by 1 until they reset their device.

**Puppeteer**: Target: Device	Duration: I	FV: L+1

You push Resonance commands into a target, forcing it to perform a Matrix Action. Pick a target and a Matrix Action for it to perform. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] against Willpower + Firewall Test with a threshold based on the type of action: 1 for a Bonus Action, 2 for Simple and 3 for Complex. If you succeed, the device performs that Matrix action.

**Redundancy**: Target: Device	Duration: S	FV: L+0

This form works with Resonance threads to better allow for secondary and tertiary connections, making the device slightly tougher for a limited amount of time. Redundancy grants additional, temporary boxes to the Matrix Damage Track of one device, giving a number of boxes equal to the hits acquired on a Simple Software + Resonance [Level] Test.

**Resonance Cache**: Target: IC	Duration: I	FV: L-2

The technomancer pushes a single IC into a stream of Resonance that isolates it, effectively locking it away. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] v Host Rating x2 opposed test. On a successful Test, the IC is locked in a Resonance fold for a number of combat turns equal to the complex form’s level.

**Resonance Channel**: Target: Device	Duration: S	FV: L-3

Instead of using Matrix channels, you communicate through a Resonance channel. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] Test. For each net hit, reduce the noise due to distance from the target device by 1.

**Resonance Spike**: Target: Device	Duration: I	FV: L-3

You send a spike of raw destructive Resonance into the target, causing errors and mayhem. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] v Willpower + Firewall Test. Your target takes 1 box of Matrix damage per net hit, with no chance to resist.

**Static Veil**: Target: Persona	Duration: S	FV: L-3

Resonance energy coils around you, hiding you from others. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] Test as a Complex Action. Add each hit as a dice pool bonus to opposed tests against Matrix Perception.

**Stitches**: Target: Sprite	Duration: P	FV: L-3

You knit the Resonance patterns in a sprite back together. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] Test as a Simple Action. For each hit, remove 1 box of Matrix damage from the target sprite.

**Tattletale**: Target: Persona	Duration: P	FV: L-3

The Resonance can be used to mimic the telltale signs of illegal activity in the Matrix – to your target’s sorrow. Make a Software + Resonance [Level] test. For each hit, increase the alarm level by 1.
### **Sprites**
Sprites are digital creatures formed out of (or summoned from, depending on who you ask) the Resonance. Sprites are then placed in the Matrix, personas without devices. Sprites are obedient and semi-autonomous but not very bright. Depending on their personality, a technomancer might think of a sprite as a tool, a program, a pet, a friend or a spirit of the machine. When a sprite’s code is analysed, it looks like a kludgy mish-mash of code snippets and junk data that shouldn’t work but does.

Sprites bend the rules of the Matrix just by existing. The Matrix isn’t really sure what to do with a sprite.

A sprite’s owner is the technomancer that compiled it and when you compile a sprite it has your Resonance signature. If its physical location is tracked, the tracker gets your physical location instead.

Sprites have a Device Rating and Resonance equal to their level and all four Matrix attributes are based on their level and the type of sprite you compile. Its Matrix Condition Monitor has 8 + (Level /2) boxes. A sprite’s initiative is also based on its Level and it has 4d6 initiative dice.
### **Sprite Actions**
**Command Spite**: Simple Action

You command a sprite to do something for you, using up one of its tasks.

**Call/Dismiss Sprite**: Simple Action

You call a registered sprite you have waiting in the Resonance, which appears at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. You can also use this action to send a sprite back to the Resonance, releasing it from any tasks it still owes you, which it does on its next action.

**Compile Sprite**: Complex Action

**Test**: Compiling + Resonance [Level] v Sprite Level

You compile a sprite.

**Decompile Sprite**: Complex Action

**Test**: Decompiling + Resonance [Level] v Sprite Level

You attempt to decompile a sprite.

**Register Sprite**: Complex Action

**Test**: Registering + Resonance [Level] v Sprite Level

You register a sprite.
### **Compiling a Sprite**
Bringing a sprite into the Matrix to work for you is called compiling. When you compile a sprite, you choose a Level for the sprite, up to twice your Resonance rating. The higher the Level, the more powerful the sprite. For every net hit on the Compile Sprite Test, you get one task from the sprite. You can spend one of these tasks having the sprite do one of the things on the list of complied sprite tasks.

Compiling sprites causes Fading of 2 DV per hit (not net hit) it gets in its defence test, with a minimum of 2 DV. This Fading is Stun damage, unless the sprite’s Level is greater than your Resonance, in which case it’s Physical damage. You can only have one compiled sprite at any given time.
### **Registered Sprite Tasks**
A task is basically one job you ask/tell your sprite to do. It has to be a simple task without conditions or heavy decision-making requirements.

**Use Sprite Power**: A single use of a sprite power.

**Matrix Actions**: One Combat Turn worth of Matrix Actions that apply to the same job.

**Combat**: Participation in cybercombat that lasts until all of the enemy combatants have been defeated or you’re escaped to safety.

**Sustain Power**: If a sprite uses a sustained power for you, sustaining that power doesn’t count against further tasks unless you change it in some way, like switching targets.

**Remote Task**: You can send a sprite to perform a remote task on another grid or in a host that you’re not in. When you send a sprite on a remote task, it vanishes back to the Resonance when it’s done and you lose any remaining tasks.
### **Registering a Sprite**
The Matrix doesn’t know what to make of sprites, so they show us as illegal activity.

You can increase your sprite’s “legitimacy” by registering them with the Matrix. This process takes a number of hours equal to the sprite’s Level; during this time neither you nor the sprite can take other actions. At the end of this time, make an Opposed Registering + Resonance [Level] v the sprite’s level x2. This causes Fading of 2 DV per hit (not net hit) the sprite gets, minimum 2 DV.

If you get at least one net hit, your sprite is registered with the Matrix. Add your net hits on the Registering test to the number of tasks your sprite owes you. The sprite is now a registered sprite and no longer counts toward your limit of one compiled sprite at a time. You can register a number of sprites equal to or less than your Charisma attribute.
### **Registered Sprite Tasks**
If you have a registered sprite, there is a special list of tasks you can have it do for you.

**Compiled Sprite Task**: A registered sprite can do anything a compiled sprite can do for you.

**Aid Study**: For the cost of one task, your registered sprite can give you a bonus equal to its Level to your dice pool when learning new complex forms. It costs one task per new complex form.

**Assist Threading**: Your registered sprite can add its Level to your dice pool to thread a complex form. This bonus lasts for one test.

**Loaned Task**: You can tell your registered sprite to follow the orders of another persona, even if that persona isn’t a technomancer. You get to pick how many tasks you’re loaning out. You don’t get to pick what those tasks will be, or what they can’t be, so make sure you trust whoever you loan your sprite to.

**Remote Task**: If send a registered sprite on a remote task, it doesn’t return to the Resonance when it’s done. Instead, it comes back to you.

**Re-register Sprite**: You can attempt to re-register the sprite for one task. If you use the sprite’s last task to do this, don’t screw up. If you succeed, add your net hits to the number of tasks the sprite owes you (minus the one for re-registering, of course). If you fail, you’re out of tasks, plain and simple.

**Standby**: You can tell your registered sprite to return to the Resonance but come when you call it. This costs a task but it keeps the sprite from giving away your presence or getting in harm’s way.

**Sustain Complex Form**: A registered sprite can sustain a complex form for you, so it takes the penalty from sustaining instead of you. Every task you use for this purpose lets the sprite sustain your complex form for up to its Level in Combat Turns. You can then take over sustaining again if you want.
### **Sprite-Technomancer Link**
You have a mental link to your sprites as long as you’re connected to the Matrix. You can communicate through this link with text, images, words and so on. If you lose your connection with the Matrix, you also lose your mental link with your sprite(s). They’ll keep working on whatever it is they were doing, but when they’re done they’ll either vanish or, if they’re registered, they’ll hang around waiting for you. Once you’re back online, you link up with your sprite(s) again.

Sprites are personas, but not devices; they can’t be part of a PAN or WAN.
### **Decompiling a Sprite**
You can decompile a sprite, trying to stuff it back into the Resonance and out of the Matrix. You can decompile your own sprites if you need to, but usually just dismissing them is enough.

To decompile a sprite, make an Opposed Decompiling + Resonance [Level] v target’s Level (+ compiler’s Resonance if the sprite is registered). Every net hit reduces the sprites owed tasks by 1. If the sprite is reduced to 0 tasks owed to its compiler, it returns to the Resonance on its next action. This causes Fading equal to 2 DV per hit (not net hit) the sprite rolls, with a minimum DV of 2.
### **Sprite Powers**
The following powers are available only to sprites. Using a sprite power is a Standard Resonance Action (not a Matrix action).

**Camouflage**: The sprite can conceal a file within another file in such a way as to make it invisible to Matrix searches. Conceal files can only be found with a Matrix Perception Test that is specifically looking for the hidden file: even the sprite must make this test in order to find and extract the file.

**Cookie**: A sprite uses its cookie power to “tag” a target persona with a cookie file that can be used to track the icon’s Matrix activities. The sprite must successfully beat the target in a Hacking + Resonance [Level] v Intuition + Firewall Test. If the sprite succeeds, the persona starts carrying the cookie file, none the wiser.

The cookie file runs silent and is protected with a Rating equal to the sprite’s Level. The file will log everything the icon does, for example each host the persona enters, the details of any communications the persona engages in (with whom and when, but not the actual contents), any programs the icon uses, etc. Use the net hits to benchmark the depth of the data the cookie accumulates.

At the end of a time determined by the sprite (or its owner) when placed, the cookie file transfers itself and its accumulated data to the sprite. Once the sprite has it, it may turn it over to the technomancer. If the sprite isn’t in the Matrix when the file transfer itself, the file is deleted.

Cookie files may be detected with a successful Matrix Perception Test performed on the carrying persona. Once identified, it may be removed by removing the file’s protection and then deleting it.

**Diagnostics**: The Diagnostics power allows the sprite to evaluate the inner workings of an electronic device. The sprite can assist someone using or repairing the device with a Teamwork Test. The sprite makes a Simple Hardware + Level [System] test; if any hits are rolled, the character gets a +1 limit bonus and each hit adds a +1 dice pool bonus to use or repair the item. This power takes the sprite’s entire attention; the bonus lasts until the sprite drops it or does something else.

**Electron Storm**: This attack allows the sprite to engulf a target persona in a sustained barrage of corrupting datastreams. If the sprite beats the target in a Cybercombat + Resonance [Level] v Intuition + Firewall test, the target is swallowed in a hail of digital pulses. With the first successful attack and on each subsequent action the sprite performs while sustaining this power, it inflicts (Resonance) DV Matrix damage, resisted as normal. The engulfing storm also causes 2 points of noise to the target. If the sprite takes any Matrix damage, all of its electron storms end immediately.

**Gremlins**: This power causes a device to mysteriously malfunction or operate in some (usually detrimental) manner. The spirit targets a device, making a Hardware + Level [Level] v Device Rating + Firewall Test. If the sprite succeeds, the device suffers a glitch. The gamesmaster chooses a malfunction appropriate to the device and situation, like a jammed control, a looped signal or a faulty reading. If the sprite scores 4 or more net hits, treat it as a critical glitch – the device crashes, burns out, jolts its user with an electrical shock or some other goodie picked by the gamesmaster.

**Hash**: The Hash power allows the sprite to temporarily protect a file with a unique Resonance algorithm in such a way that only the sprite can unprotect it. If the sprite stops carrying the hashed file, it reverts to normal. If the sprite is destroyed while carrying the file, the hashed file is permanently corrupted and becomes worthless. The maximum time the sprite can use this power is Level x10 Combat Turns.

**Stability**: A sprite can use this power on any persona or device it has gained an access level to. Stability prevents normal malfunctions or accidents from afflicting the target (including both standard glitches and those induced by the Gremlins or Accident powers). Ignore standard glitches and reduce critical glitches to standard glitches.

**Suppression**: Sprites are confusing at the best of time but a sprite using suppression is just bizarre, especially to hosts. If a sprite is in a host and using this power when the host launches IC, that IC is delayed from launching by (Level/2) Combat Turns. Delayed IC can’t act or be targeted.

**Watermark**: The sprite can tag an icon with an invisible marking that only Resonance-driven entities can see, kind of like a Matrix signature. This allows the sprite to secretly leave messages on Matrix objects. A sprite can overwrite an existing watermark with a new one. A watermark can be erased with the Erase Matrix Signature action; otherwise it lasts as long as the icon does.
### **Sprite Database**
There are different types of sprites that technomancers may compile and rumours abound that there are other kinds in the Resonance. A sprite’s limit on Matrix Actions is their Level.

**Companion Sprite**: Companion sprites are always by your side, right where you need them. They exist to protect and serve.

<a name="_hlk204589995"></a>\
**<a name="_toc218024814"></a>EQUIPMENT**\

=========================================
### **Concealing Gear**
It’s not just about firepower; sometimes you need to choose the right tool for the setting. Failure to do this can mean getting arrested for carrying a deadly weapon before you make it from the meet to where the job is supposed to go down. Surprise is a shadowrunner’s best friend and carrying a properly hidden hold-out can mean the difference between life and death. As a shadowrunner, you commonly tote around things you don’t want casual onlookers to observe. Things that would attract unwanted attention, even if they aren’t technically illegal. Or hidden “equalisers” you want to act as your ace in the hole. Some items are easier to hide than others, obviously: most hold-out pistols can be stowed away in a bathing suit if that’s what you happen to be wearing, but as awesome as it would be, hiding a katana under your long coat isn’t easy.
### **Noticing Hidden Gear**
Have the observing character make a Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test with a dice pool modified by the item’s Concealability to determine whether they notice the item. This test should be penalised normally by distractions, distance and visibility modifiers. If the observing character generates at least one success, they notice the item concealed on someone else’s person.
### **Actively Hiding Gear**
If you’re intentionally trying to hide something on your person that somebody else is looking for and you’ve taken a little time to hide it (like a Complex Action or so), making an Opposing Palming + Agility [Physical] v Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test. The observing character’s dice pool is modified by the item’s Concealability and they can use Palming in place of Perception if wanted.

If you’re being physically patted down, the searcher can use Agility and their Physical limit instead of Intuition and the Mental limit. Additionally, any negative Concealability modifier is cut in half and any positive Concealability modifier is doubled.

|**Modifier**|**Example Items**|
| :- | :- |
|**-6**|RFID tag, slap patch, microdrone, contact lenses|
|**-4**|Hold-out Pistol, Ammo Clip, Credstick, Lockpick Set, Glasses|
|**-2**|Light Pistol, Knife, Sap, Minidrone|
|**0**|Heavy Pistol, Grenade, Goggles|
|**+2**|SMG, Machine Pistol with Folding Stock Extended, Small Drone, Stun Baton|
|**+4**|Sword, Sawn-off Shotgun, Bullpup Assault Rifle|
|**+6**|Katana, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Crossbow|
|**+8**|Sniper Rifle, Bow, Medium Drone|
|**Forget about it**|Machine gun, rocket launcher, missile launcher, staff, claymore, metahuman body|
### **Carrying Gear**
As long as the players are reasonable and don’t perpetually carry around every firearm and toaster in creation (with enough ammo and bread to operate them both continuously), weights and encumbrance aren’t important. There may, however, be circumstances where knowing roughly how much your character can carry may have an impact on the story – like if you break into a vault full of heavy gold bars and need to figure out how many guns you have to drop to haul out the maximum amount.
#### **Carrying Capacity**
Characters can carry their Strength x 10 kilograms in weight without any sort of test – this is your **carrying capacity**. Lifting and carrying more calls for a Strength + Body Test. Each hit increases the weight you can carry by another 10 kilograms.
#### **Encumbrance**
If a character overburdens themselves with gear, they suffer encumbrance modifiers. For every 15 kilograms (or part thereof) by which you exceed your carrying capacity, you suffer a -1 modifier to your Physical Limit (minimum limit of 1). This means that a character with Strength 3 (Carrying Capacity 30) that is trudging along with 50 kilograms of equipment suffers a -2 penalty to their Physical Limit.
### **Commlinks**
Commlinks are universal communication devices; they’re used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music player, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image camera, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chips players, credstick readers, voice-access dialling, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, access to ID and accounts, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.

### **Software**
Software can be purchased as an online download or less commonly on chip from physical stores.

**Datasofts**: Datasofts encompass a wide variety of information files, databases containing information on everything from hydraulic fracking to 18<sup>th</sup> century romantic poetry. An appropriate datasoft gives you a +1 bonus to your Mental limit on related Knowledge Skill Tests.

**Mapsofts**: Mapsoft programs feature detailed information about a particular area, from streets to business/residential listings to topographical, census, GPS and environmental data. An interactive interface allows you to quickly determine the best routes and directions, locate the nearest spot of your choice or create your own customised maps. If a wireless link and subscription is maintained, the map automatically self-updates with the latest data from GridGuide. Of course, this feature also means that the mapsoft can be used to track your location.

**Tutorsofts**: These virtual private tutors aid you in learning a specific skill. The tutorsoft makes Instruction Tests with a dice pool equal to its Rating x2. Tutorsofts cannot teach skills based on Magic or Resonance.

*Datasoft*			Variable from 10¥ - 100,000¥		Legal

*Mapsoft*						100¥		Legal

*Tutorsoft	(Rating 1-6)*				Rating x400¥	Legal
### **Skillsofts**
A skillsoft program is a recorded skill – digital knowledge and muscle memory. When used in conjunction with the proper augmentations (a **skilljack** for knowsofts and linguasofts as well as a **skillwire system** for activesofts), skillsofts let you know and do things you’ve never otherwise learned. Even kung fu.

Skillsofts aren’t educational tools; you can’t actually learn from them. They’re highly favoured by corporations interested in a cheaper labour force (when the difference between a skilled and unskilled worker can be as simple as slotting a chip, the difference in salary is smaller).

When a skill test is called for, the character may use the Skillsoft in place of the skill. Downside: tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way.

**Activesofts**: Activesofts replace physical active skills, basically every Active skill that isn’t based on Magic or Resonance. A skillwire system is needed to translate the ‘softs into usable muscle memory. There’s a limit to the number of skills you can use at once, based on your skillwire’s rating.

**Knowsofts**: Knowsofts replicate Knowledge skills, actively overwriting the user’s knowledge with their own data. Knowsofts must be accessed with a skilljack and the number you can use at once is limited by the skilljack.

**Linguasofts**: Linguasofts replicate language skills, allowing a user to speak a foreign language by automatically translating signals from the speech cortex, although chipped speech can be awkward and stilted - then again, so can anyone speaking a language that’s not their native tongue. Linguasofts must be accessed with a skilljack, which limits how many skillsofts you can use at a time.

### **ID and Credit**

**Fake System Identification Number (SIN) (Rating 1-4)** 			Forbidden Legality

In 2075, you’re just a number. A SIN is what makes a mere metahuman into a real person. Solid citizens receive their SINs at birth and carry them until they die. Not having a SIN means living outside the system, living with restricted or non-existent civil rights. Shadowrunners by default are SINless – they have a SIN only if they have the SINner quality. SINs are digital, not physical objects. They exist on your commlink or in your PAN.

**Sidebar**: While having some sort of SIN is mandatory for a person to interact in any way with the “civilized” (as they would put it) world, the level to which a SIN is checked and verified varies widely based on the situation and who is doing the checking. A device checking a SIN will roll a Device Rating x2 Test. The threshold is equal to the rating of the **Fake Sin**. If the number of hits is under the threshold, the system reports no problem. If the threshold is reached but not exceeded, the system reports that something seems “odd” with the SIN and will recommend that the operator investigate further. Whether the operator actually does anything is up to them. If the threshold is exceeded, the system reports the SIN as false and may immediately notify the authorities. At this point, the fake SIN is considered burned.

**Fake Licence (Rating 1-4)**							Forbidden Legality

For those who can’t or won’t go through the standard legal channels, fake licences are available for all kinds of restricted items and activities. Licences are for *Restricted* items. Each type of item or activity permission typically requires a separate licence. Just as SINs essentially exist on your commlink, fake licences exist on a SIN and are linked to it. When you buy a fake concealed-carry licence, you don’t buy it for Murderman the professional shadowrunner, you buy it for John Doe, one of Murderman’s fake SINs. Each licence must be assigned to a particular (fake) SIN and match its rating. 

|**Licence**|**Rating 1**|**Rating 2**|**Rating 3**|**Rating 4**|

*Certified Credstick								Legal*

Cash for the late 21<sup>st</sup> century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person – the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorisation to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They’re not even wireless – you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed below. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it – so don’t get excited when you see a gold credstick until you’ve slotted it and checked its balance.

|**Credstick**|**Max Value**|**Cost**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Standard**|5000|5¥|
|**Silver**|20,000|20¥|
|**Gold**|100,000|100¥|
|**Platinum**|500,000|500¥|

*Online Banking Account							Legal*

Online banking accounts can be accessed at any time via your commlink. Transactions require passcode or biometric verification to be authorised. The good news in no one can (physically) steal your bank account and hacking credit accounts often requires a run to Zurich Orbital or something equally suicidal. The bad news in that digital transactions leave a “paper trail” that, while it can be hidden or concealed, is entirely too traceable for serious criminal activities. Each account must be registered to a particular (usually fake) SIN, unless the account is handled by an anonymous underworld banking service (with its own risks and complications). The cost of banking services is included in your lifestyle costs if you’ve got a Low Lifestyle or better – otherwise you’ll need to keep all your money on credsticks.

<a name="_hlk204589980"></a>*Public Transportation Monthly Pass				50¥		Legal*

You have a monthly pass to access public transportation in your city. This includes bus, subway, ferry or any combination of them. This means, from most places within the city you have transportation access to your destination, with the caveat that it’s not as fast as you make like it.
### **Clothing**
In 2075, you’d have to be crazy to consider walking outside with just a tee-shirt and jeans, even in some of the nicer parts of the Sprawl.

This is a sexy, sick, twisted version of body armour. Each piece of the Second Skin line is custom tailored for the user, which means that a shift in weight of as little as one or two kilos will make the armour lose its most amazing benefit.

#### **Might Raise an Eyebrow Wear**

*Blackout Catsuit			Armour 11			6,650¥		Legal*

This full-body, skin-tight armour leaves little to the imagination but requires a custom-fit. A shift in weight as little as one or two kilos can cause problems.

### **Melee Weapons**
Melee weapons are for ending the lives of people conveniently within arm’s reach. Some runners swear by them, especially those who prefer to kill silently or are afraid of hackers bricking their guns. The damage value of most melee weapons is based on the wielder’s Strength, modified by the weapon.
#### **Blades**
Use the Blades skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Blades is the wielder’s Physical Limit.

*Ceramic/Plasteel Knife		Reach -	(STR +1)P	AP-1		75¥		Legal*

Ceramic knives are lightweight and non-metallic that are primarily sold as specialty tools. Divers use them because they are resistant to saltwater corrosion and explosive defusing experts use them because they are non-metallic and will not trigger bombs with magnetic anomaly detectors. Plasteel knives share most characteristics with ceramic knives, including being undetectable to MAD scanners. They are most commonly handmade from scraps taken from machinery or vehicles. A few designs are mass manufactured but generally ceramic is the preferred medium due to superior edge retention under heavy use. Both are equally useful to a shadowrunner who wants to sneak a blade into a secure area.

*Claymore, Highland Forge	Reach 2	(STR +5)P	AP-4		4,500¥		Licence Restricted*

Quality killing in the classic Scottish fashion. An ideal accessory for the troll who thinks a regular sword makes a better toothpick.

A two-handed tungsten-alloy monster, available single- or double-bladed. A hardened thrusting point on be concealed, spring-loaded, in the handle. While it may seem barbaric or primitive, the physical augmentations of 2075 can make an old-school weapon like a combat axe even deadlier than a firearm in the right hands. So go ahead, go medieval.

*Combat Knife			Reach -	(STR +2)P	AP-3		300¥		Legal*

A long, KA-BAR-style fighting knife with a blacked-out blade and a chisel point for punching through armour.

*Forearm Snap Blades		Reach -	(STR +2)P	AP-2		300¥		Licence Restricted*

Simply concealed under loose clothing, these are externally strapped on – painless to install or remove. The forearm sheath conceals three blade that can be extended or retracted with a Use Device Action.

*Katana				Reach 1	(STR +3)P	AP-3		1,000¥		Licence Restricted*

The legendary sword of the samurai. The katana has become synonymous not just with street samurai, but with shadowrunners in general, at least in the trids; they’ve got everyone packing a katana, from the decker to the mage. But being a silly cliché doesn’t make this blade any less dangerous or less helpful in a fight.

*Knife				Reach -	(STR +1)P	AP-1		10¥		Legal*

Your basic, all-purpose street cutter. It comes in a bewildering array of styles, colours and flavours, but the statistics don’t vary from one to the next. Ordinary knives are used by the poor, the desperate or the cautious as backup weapons.

“There can be only One” is Ares latest slogan for this classic. This tool of the modernised street samurai features a monofilament line along the edge that provides incredible penetration potential.

*Nodachi, Nippon Steel		Reach 2	(STR +5)P	AP-4		4,500¥		Licence Restricted*

For those who crave a samurai-style extra long blade, the Nippon Steel Nodachi offers reach and power with style.

*Nunchaku			Reach 1	(STR +2)P	AP+0		75¥		Licence Restricted*

Thought to have its origin as an Okinawan farming tool, the nunchaku is comprised of two short sticks made of wood, metal or plastic, fastened together by a short length of chain or rope. When properly used, nunchaku can deliver a flurry of blows from a variety of angles. Nunchaku can also be used to choke opponents.

*Pole Arm			Reach 2	(STR +3)P	AP-2		1,000¥		Licence Restricted*

This is, at its very essence, a blade on the end of a very long stick. It usually features an axe-head, glaive, spear point or similar maiming implement. It’s not easy to handle and it’s just about impossible to conceal, but it’s popular both with trolls and with melee combatants looking to safely keep said large trolls at more than arm’s length.

*Rapier, Horizon-Flynn	Reach 1	(STR +2)P	AP-3			500¥		Licence Restricted*

Not every street samurai studies the art of kenjutsu. Some prefer the more elegant Flore del Liberi and thus choose the rapier over the common katana. Horizon and world-renowned bladesmith Dante Flynn have joined forces to create the ultimate tool for slipping past a flawed defence and finding a home in the heart of an enemy. The Horizon-Flynn blade is a slender composite designed for strength, flexibility and stability for maximum armour penetration.

*Sword				Reach 1	(STR +2)P	AP-2		300¥		Licence Restricted*

It’s sharp, it’s heavy and it will fragging cut you wide open. Available in a wide variety of styles (wakizashi, scimitar, machete, and so on and so forth), this one-handed blade is not as formidable as a katana but is substantially easier to hide.

*Swordcane			Reach 1	(STR +2)P	AP-2		500¥		Legal*

A single or double edges blade roughly 30 centimetres long designed in the Heian period that is one of the most revered samurai blade in Japanese history, worn by feudal Japan’s samurai class.
#### **Clubs**
Use the Clubs skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Clubs is the wielder’s Physical Limit.

*Club				Reach 1	(STR +3)P	AP+0		30¥		Legal*

The weapon they named the skill after. These stats represent a range of objects, including an axe handle, baseball bat, prybar, tire iron and a two-by-four with a rusty nail in it.

*Extendable Baton		Reach 1	(STR +2)P	AP+0		100¥		Legal*

This telescoping club can be collapsed and it can be extended with a sharp flick of the wrist or a wireless signal. When retracted, it’s more easily concealed (Concealability 0 when retracted, +2 when extended). Reading the extendable baton is a Use Device action.

*Sap				Reach 0	(STR +2)P	AP+0		50¥		Legal*

Also called a blackjack, this is a small, springy club or a flat piece of iron in a flexible leather covering. It’s specially designed for concealment (Concealability -2).

*Staff				Reach 2	(STR +3)P	AP+0		100¥		Legal*

This large, heavy stick is popular with magicians going for that traditional look. Available in composite, hardwood, high-carbon steel and other materials.

*Stun Baton			Reach 1	9S(elec)	AP-5		750¥		Licence Restricted*

A standard riot-control weapon, viewed as a tool and symbol of corporate-government oppressors but pragmatically useful to runners.

*Stun Staff, Nemesis Arms	Reach 2	9S(elec)	AP-5		1,000¥		Licence Restricted*

Double-sided zapping power! The stun staff is basically a staff with stun batons on each end. They’re rather large and a bit ugly but they look quite intimidating in the hands of the guards at Shiawase HQ.

*Telescoping Staff		Reach 2	(STR+3)P	AP+0		350¥		Legal*

This is a metal and composite staff than can telescope down to a reasonable size, one that can be concealed about as easily as a stun baton. It can be extended and lock in place by whirling it at the correct speed and angle and twisting the grip or via a wireless signal. Reading the telescoping staff is a Use Device Action.
#### **Fist Weapons**
Use the Unarmed Combat skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Fist Weapons is the wielder’s Physical Limit.

*Knucks			Reach -	(STR+1)P	AP+0			100¥		Licence Restricted*

These may be traditional fist-load weapons like brass knuckles or modern “Hardliner gloves” with a thin layer of densiplast located along the knuckles and the edge of the hand. Either way, they substantially boost the impact of a punch, making it potentially deadly.

*Shock Gloves		Reach -	9S(elec)	AP-5			550¥		Licence Restricted*

These electrically insulated gloves have a wire mesh that discharges electric current with a punch or a simple touch. The gloves deal electrical damage and are good for ten charges before they need to be plugged in and recharged (at a rate of one charge per ten seconds). If wireless is enabled, it recharged by induction, regaining one charge per full hour of wireless-enabled time.
### **Projectile and Throwing Weapons**
These weapons are primarily muscle-powered, although some might use simple mechanical assistance for added distance or speed.
#### **Bows**
Use the Archery skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Bows is listed in the weapon description.

Bow		Rating 10		Accuracy: Physical	12P	AP-2		1,000¥	Legal

Arrow		Rating 1-10						Rating x2¥		Legal

This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075 and both have the advantage of being hacker-proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action.

Bows have Rating that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Strength minimum suffer a 3 dice pool penalty per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow.

The weapon’s Rating is also used to determine its range and damage (maximum Rating is 10). Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow’s Rating or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-allow bow tends to turn wood or fibreglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.
#### **Crossbows**
Use the Archery skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Crossbows is listed in the weapon description.

*Light Crossbow		Accuracy: 7		5P	AP-1		300¥		Legal*

*Heavy Crossbow	Accuracy: 7		10P	AP-3		1,000¥		Licence Restricted*

*Crossbow Bolt								5¥		Legal*

Modern crossbows are equipped with automatic reloading devices, so unless you’re using a museum piece, reloading doesn’t require a Ready Weapon action. Crossbows have internal magazines holding up to 4 bolts. Crossbows are available in Light, Medium and Heavy sizes.
#### **Throwing Blades**
Use the Thrown Weapons skill to wield these weapons. The Accuracy for Throwing Blades is listed in the weapon description.

*Throwing Blades	Accuracy: Physical	 (STR+1)P	AP-1	25¥		Licence Restricted*

A wide variety of shapes and sizes of aerodynamically balanced, specially weighted, muscle-powered throwing weapons are available, from throwing spikes to darts to kunai and shuriken. A character can ready (Agi/2) of these blades with one Ready Weapon action.
### **Tasers**
Tasers are legal to carry and a great choice for non-lethally incapacitating someone. Tasers, like other electrical weapons, have a flat Armour Penetration value of -5 and deal electricity damage. Use the Handguns skill to fire a taser. Tasers can take only top-mounted accessories.

*Cavalier Safeguard	Accuracy: 5(6)	SA	6S(elec)	AP-5	6 (mag)	275¥	Legal*

A reliable self-defence weapon, this taser forgoes some wattage in each dart for a larger ammunition capacity and back this with a top-mounted laser for increased accuracy for a less skilled shooter. It still looks sufficiently enough like a pistol to still intimidate targets who might scoff at a mere taser.
> `	`*Laser Sight*
\*\
`	`This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1 and grants a +1 dice pool bonus, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device action.

*Defiance EX Shocker	Accuracy: 4		SS	9S(elec)	AP-5	4 (mag)	250¥	Legal*

*(in melee)		Accuracy: Physical	8S(elec)		AP-5	Reach 0*

This heavy-duty taser fires up to 4 darts that trail wires up to 20 metres long. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock. Most modern tasers use wireless darts, so the Defiance EX Shocker is an exception. It also features contacts that allow it to be used as a stun weapon in melee.

A successful hit with an active wireless connection informs you of the status of the target’s basic health.

*Tiffani-Defiance Protector	Accuracy: 5(6)   SA	7S(elec)	AP-5	3 (mag)	400¥	Legal*

A sleek taser designed to accessorise well with women’s fashions, with the added benefit of geckogrip to allow it to be set anywhere that is comfortable on the body and a sleek top-mounted laser sight for quick targeting. This is a perfect choice to go with the immortal little black dress, stored under the dashboard of a car or put next to the bed for a good night’s sleep.

Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device action.
> `	`*Gecko Grip*
\*\
`	`Having trouble holding on to your gun? Then maybe you shouldn’t have one. But if that’s not an option, try gecko grip, which makes your piece stick in your hand like, well, a gecko hanging on a wall. This gives your grip a bunch of tiny fibres that are awfully clingy to just about anything. The fibres can be turned on and off via a wireless command or by pressing two buttons at the same time. The mod gives a +6 dice pool bonus on any test to see if a character keeps their grip on the gun. It can also be used to stick the gun to your jacket, back or roof of your car.

*Tiffani-Defiance Chameleon	Accuracy: 5(6)	SA	7S(elec)	AP-5    3 (mag)	1,400¥	Licence Restricted*

In addition to the benefits of the Tiffani-Defiance Protector (above), this unadvertised model includes a coating of ruthenium polymers for optical camouflage. Blending in with the colours behind the taser, this modification applies a -2 Concealability modifier to the taser.

*Yamaha Pulsar			Accuracy: 5	SA	7S(elec)	AP-5	4 (mag)	180¥	Legal*

The darts of this taser contain wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar eliminates the need for cumbersome wires. As a trade-off, it is slightly less powerful than the EX Shocker, although it can fire faster. It lacks the EX Shocker’s melee contacts.

A successful hit with an active wireless connection informs you of the status of the target’s basic health.
### **Hold-Outs**
Hold-out pistols are very concealable and are perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up piece. They don’t have much else going for them, being both weak and inaccurate. Use the Handguns skill when firing a hold-out pistol. Hold-outs can’t take mounted accessories.

*Colt New Model Revolver	Accuracy: 6	SA	5P		AP+0	5 (cy)	180¥	Licence Restricted*

The New Model Revolver is Colt’s return to the small-revolver market, launched with a marketing campaign aimed at young homeowners and small security firms. The New Model is manufactured in a variety of small calibre and is largely of conventional design. The cylinder uses a simple left-side drop to allow rapid reloading with the appropriate manufacturer-approved speed loader. This model is only produced at Colt’s Connecticut facility and has largely remained rare outside of northeastern UCAS. Inside the UCAS, citizens can be proud to purchase from one of their homegrown success stories. Trust the quality of a proven manufacturer. Trust the Legend.

*Fichetti Tiffani Needler		Accuracy: 5	SA	8P(f)		AP+5	4 (c)	1,000¥	Licence Restricted*

Designed to appeal to social climbers and debutantes, the Tiffani Needler is available in a wide variety of colours and styles. It also has a special colour-changing coating that can be manipulated via wireless signal. This is useful to make sure your gun matches with your shoes or your handbag. The Needler can only fire flechette rounds. You can change the colours of the Tiffani Needler with a Use Device Action.

*Raecor Sting			Accuracy: 4	SS	6P(f)		AP+5	5 (c)	500¥	Licence Restricted*

The Sting is commonly referred to as a “lemon-squeezer” design, meaning the barrel protrudes from between the firer’s index and middle fingers and the gun is fired by simply making a fist. The circular magazine rotates and automatically loads the next mini-flechette round. Constructed entirely from polyresins, the Sting cannot be detected by magnetic weapon detection systems.

*Streetline Special		Accuracy: 4	SA	6P		AP+0	6 (c)	120¥	Licence Restricted*

Popular among society’s dregs, the Streetline Special is a small, lightweight weapon made of composite materials. Magnetic Anomaly Detectors (MAD Scanners) suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to detect it.

*Walther Palm Pistol		Accuracy: 4	SS/BF	7P		AP+0	2 (b)	180¥	Licence Restricted*

This is a classic double-barreled derringer in an over-under barrel combination. It packs a punch for its size, but on the downside has one of the most diminutive “magazine” capacities on the market – just one bullet per barrel. Both barrels can be fired at once as a short burst (for a -1 Defence modifier instead of the normal -2 for Burst Fire).
### **Light Pistol**
Light pistols are highly accurate and fairly concealable, occupying a comfortable middle ground between Hold-outs and Heavy Pistols. They’re extremely common the streets. Use the Handguns skill when firing a light pistol. Light pistol can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

|**Range**|**Short**|**Medium**|**Long**|**Extreme**|

*Beretta 201T			Accuracy: 6	SA/BF	6P		AP+0	21 (c)	210¥	Licence Restricted*

This light sidearm is used by many security professionals. It is capable of burst fire. Since the 201T is classified as a light pistol without further limitations, it is quite popular with security agencies in countries where heavy pistols and machine pistols are hard to come by legally. Semi-automatic burst using the Beretta 201T require a Simple Action. The weapon includes a detachable shoulder stock.

*Cavalier Arms Adder Slivergun	Accuracy: 5	SA	8P(f)		AP+5	20 (c)	320¥	Licence Restricted*

Oddly enough, this gun was developed as a lightweight personal protection weapon for a mail-delivery corp. Management’s logic was that flechette ammo would be more effective against aggressive dogs and similar paracritters while being less intimidating to customers. It is reminiscent of a pared-down Ares Viper Slivergun. With the modification of an aftermarket silencer, this gun is exceptionally handy for sneaking into a location and striking while the target’s guard is down.

*Colt Agent Special		Accuracy: 5	SA	8P		AP+0	8 (c)	250¥	Licence Restricted*

The Agent Special has been one of Colt’s bestsellers since its introduction over a century ago and continuing updates and upgrades keep it more than relevant. The weapon’s large calibre makes it popular with shooters who prefer hitting power over range. The short barrel also reduces the round’s penetrative power but the ability to use the same ammunition as a heavy pistol means that some organisations are turning to this steady performer to simplify their logistics.

*Colt America L36		Accuracy: 7	SA	7P		AP+0	11 (c)	320¥	Licence Restricted*

A venerable pistol with a great reputation. This basic firearm is cheap, easily concealed and nearly ubiquitous. A perfect throwaway weapon.

*Fichetti Executive Action	Accuracy: 6	SA/BF	7P		AP+0	18 (c)	300¥	Licence Restricted*

“Manage your danger with Executive Action!” is the latest in a long series of taglines for this pistol, which incorporates a burst-fire option as standard. With no other truly compelling features, marketing is what this firearm mostly has going for it but that appears to be all it needs to keep selling well.

*Fichetti Security 600		Accuracy: 6(7)	SA	7P		AP+0	30 (c)	350¥	Licence Restricted*

A light sidearm for security forces, this weapon’s highly efficient feeding mechanism allows it a thirty-round magazine. The Fichetti Security 600 comes with a detachable folding stock and under-barrel mounted laser sight.

`	`This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1 and grants a +1 dice pool bonus, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device action.
> `	`*Folding Stock*
\*\
`	`This is a stock. That folds into the weapon. Got it? It provides 1 point of recoil compensation – but only, of course, when it is out and braced against the user’s shoulder. It must be installed in the stock slot and requires a Simple Action to move in or out.

*SK Katzbalger			Accuracy: 6(8)	SA	7P		AP+0	12 (c)	1,750¥	Licence Restricted*
> `	`*Electronic Firing*
\*\
`	`With this modification, most of the weapon’s moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet’s propellant. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation and a -1 dice pool modifier to sound-based Perception Tests when trying to locate where the weapon is being fired from. The weapon still includes a loading mechanism that moves the bullet into the chamber and it requires caseless ammunition.
> `	`*Trigger Removal*
\*\
`	`Sometimes the time it takes to move a finger is too long. Sometimes the pressure of squeezing a trigger is enough to throw off the precision of a long range shot. This is the modification for those times. A smartgun system is necessary for trigger removal, since the gun requires a command delivered wirelessly or through an optical cable to fire. This modification adds +1 Accuracy but is not cumulative with any other modification that adds to Accuracy other than the requisite smartlink. Wireless triggering requires wireless to be turned on. In case you were wondering.
> `	`*Smartgun System, Internal*
\*\
`	`This connects a firearm to the user’s smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and a laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup and material stress. You can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

Developed for a niche market, this light pistol has had most of the moving parts removed to increase reliability and firing electronically without a trigger, while connected to the wielder with an internal smartgun system. The smartlink provides a +1 dice pool bonus to all attacks with the weapon or +2 if you’re using an augmentation for which you paid Essence.
### **Heavy Pistol**
Heavy Pistols are powerful sidearms that are a good compromise between concealability and firepower. When you shoot a heavy pistol, you use the Handguns skill. Heavy pistols can take top- and barrel-mounted accessories.

*Ares Predator V		Accuracy: 5(7)	SA	8P		AP-1	15 (c)	725¥	Licence Restricted*

The newest iteration of the most popular handgun in the world, especially with mercenaries and shadowrunners. Upgraded with improved ergonomics and handling features, the Ares Predator V includes a smartgun system. Some say that the Ares Predator V isn’t better than other guns in its class, but no one can argue that it has better brand recognition.

*Cavalier Deputy		Accuracy: 6	SA	7P		AP-1	7 (c)	225¥	Licence Restricted*

With the return of Western aesthetics in fashion, the Deputy has become a choice for modern-day urban cowboys and gunslingers. Less punishing to the wrist and carrying a seven-chamber cylinder, this pistol is a choice competitor to the Ruger Super Warhawk.

*Colt Government 2046		Accuracy: 6	SA	7P		AP-1	14 (c)	425¥	Licence Restricted*

This government-issue weapon, styled after the legendary Colt M1911a1 uses an electrically induced spark to detonate the bullet’s propellants. The removal of the most moving parts from the firing mechanism gives this weapon a reputation for being exceptionally reliable.
> *Electronic Firing*
\*\
`	`With this modification, most of the weapon’s moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet’s propellant.

*Colt Manhunter			Accuracy: 5(6)	SA	8P		AP-1	16 (c)	700¥	Licence Restricted*

Falling a distant third place between the constant advertising battle between the Savalette Guardian and the Ares Predator V, Colt has taken a different track with the latest iteration of the Manhunter. Shifting everything back to traditional mechanical mechanisms with the exception of a holographic sight. The worst a hacker can do is make you slightly less accurate with this gun and that appeals to a lot of the less technologically-minded consumers. While production numbers are currently significantly smaller than its competitors, it is still readily available and a common sight on the streets.

*Savalette Guardian		Accuracy: 5 (7)	SS/BF\*	8P		AP-1	12 (c)	870¥	Licence Restricted*

This heavily chromed street monster of a pistol has been popular in the shadows for over two decades. A heavy pistol with an integrated smartgun link, an internal micro-gyro recoil absorption system and the option for burst firing, it’s a very reasonable weapon for an experienced owner who expects to be in heavy combat. Recoil Compensation 1.

*Remington Roomsweeper	Accuracy: 4	SA	7P		AP-1	8 (m)	250¥	Licence Restricted*

This is really more of a short-barrelled shotgun than a pistol.

*Ruger Super Warhawk		Accuracy: 5	SS	9P		AP-2	6 (cy)	400¥	Licence Restricted*

This revolver is as loud as a jet liner and twice as shiny. It’s also one of the scariest handguns in the world. The cased ammo variant is popular for the sheer thrill of swinging open the cylinder gate one handed and dumping spent brass.
### **Machine Pistol**

Sometimes the job calls for the ability to fire more shots without taking time to reload. That is what an extended clip is for. A Rating 1 Extended Clip adds 50% more rounds to the gun’s capacity. The downside is that it makes the gun a bit harder to hide (+1 Concealability). More of an accessory that a modification, an Extended Clip does not use any modification slots.

> `	`*Shock Pad*

`	`A shock-absorbing pad is situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun or heavy weapon and provides 1 point of recoil compensation.
> `	`*Foregrip*

`	`This is a handle you put on in the front of the weapon to give you a sturdier grip. It can be mounted on the barrel or underneath slots and it cannot be used on Pistols and Hold-outs. It provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation and adds 1 to the Concealability of the weapon to which it’s attached.  
> `	`*Smartgun System, Internal*

This connects a firearm to the user’s smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and a laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup and material stress. You can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.
> `	`*Electronic Firing*
\*\
`	`With this modification, most of the weapon’s moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet’s propellant. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation and a -1 dice pool modifier to sound-based Perception Tests when trying to locate where the weapon is being fired from. The weapon still includes a loading mechanism that moves the bullet into the chamber and it requires caseless ammunition.
> `	`*Trigger Removal*
\*\
`	`Sometimes the time it takes to move a finger is too long. Sometimes the pressure of squeezing a trigger is enough to throw off the precision of a long range shot. This is the modification for those times. A smartgun system is necessary for trigger removal, since the gun requires a command delivered wirelessly or through an optical cable to fire. This modification adds +1 Accuracy but is not cumulative with any other modification that adds to Accuracy other than the requisite smartlink. Wireless triggering requires wireless to be turned on. In case you were wondering.
> `	`*Advanced Safety System*

It’s always good to make sure your weapon only goes off when you want it to. The advanced safety system works along with your smartlink (meaning that you need a smartlink to have one of these) to make sure only an authorized user fires the gun. There are a few ways to pull this off – one is to have biometric scanners in the grip or butt of the weapon or the system can scan for an authorized RFID tag to PAN within 1 meter of the weapon. If the authorized user(s) is present or holding the gun, it’ll be ready to fire. If not, no dice.
> `	`*Imaging Scope*

`	`These classic scopes are attached to the top mount; attaching or removing them takes only a Simple Action. Imaging scopes include a micro camera and vision magnification and they have a Capacity of 3 to hold vision enhancements.
> `	`*Extended Clip II*

Sometimes the job calls for the ability to fire more shots without taking time to reload. That is what an extended clip is for. A Rating 2 Extended Clip adds 100% more rounds to the gun’s capacity. The downside is that it makes the gun a bit harder to hide (+1 Concealability). More of an accessory that a modification, an Extended Clip does not use any modification slots.
### **Sniper Rifles**
Use the Longarms skills when firing sniper rifles. Firearm enthusiasts will be the first to tell you that sport and hunting rifles are technically not sniper rifles but they are similar enough in terms of game statistics to be included here rather than in their own section. Sniper rifles can take top-, barrel- and underbarrel-mounted accessories.

|**Range**|**Short**|**Medium**|**Long**|**Extreme**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Sniper Rifle**|0-50m|51-350m|351-800m|801-1,500m|

*Defiance T-250		Accuracy: 4	SS/SA	10P	RC -	AP-1	5 (m)	450¥	Licence Restricted*

A common sight on the mean street when things escalate beyond pistols and knives, this semi-automatic shotgun is available in either a normal-length or short-barrelled version. It is gas operated but also features a secondary pump action for situations where preventing jams is more important that quickly firing a second shot. The short-barrelled version has the concealability of +4, the range of a heavy pistol and a DV of 9P.

A solid, no-frills design, the 990 has been in steady production for almost seventy years and is widely available in almost every part of the world. Professionals appreciate the weapon’s ruggedness and reliability right out of the box while novices appreciate its ease of use and low cost. The 990 comes standard with a top rail mount and a smaller mount near the fore-stock for accessories.
### **Ammunition**
Ammunition is defined by type (regular, gel, APDS, etc.) class of firearm (light pistol, heavy pistol, assault rifle, etc) and as cased and caseless. Unless indicated otherwise in its description, a gun can fire cased or caseless ammo, but not both.

For simplicity, each kind of gun can trade ammo with another of its class: for example, all heavy pistols can share ammo.

An ammunition type’s Damage Modifier and AP Modifier are added to the weapon’s usual DV and AP.

*APDS rounds		DV+0		AP-4			(per 10 rounds)	200¥	Forbidden Legality*

These are military-grade armour piercing rounds – their full name is armour piercing discarding sabot. They are designed to travel at high velocities and punch through personal body armour. They are highly restricted and hard to acquire.

*Flechette rounds	DV+2		AP+5			(per 10 rounds)	65¥	Licence Restricted*

The payload of a flechette round is made up of tiny, tightly packed metal slivers. The round breaks up and shatters on impact, becoming a tumbling hail of shrapnel. Flechette rounds are devastating against unprotected targets, but not as effective against hardened armour.

*Gel rounds		DV Stun	AP+1			(per 10 rounds)	25¥	Licence Restricted*

These less-lethal rounds use a hard, jelly-like substance that is a safer alternative to rubber bullets. They are often employed for riot control. Their usually semi-rigid slugs flatten on impact, dispersing their kinetic energy over a larger-than-normal area. Gel rounds inflict Stun damage. Gel rounds reduce the target’s Physical limit by 2 when checking for **Knockdown**.

*Hollow points		DV+1		AP+2			(per 10 rounds)	70¥	Licence Restricted*

Hollow point rounds have their tips indented, so they are designed to “mushroom” or expand on impact, becoming a hail of deadly fragments not unlike flechettes, although hollow points are a much older technology. Like flechettes, follow points work better on unarmoured targets and tend to flatten against armour.

*Regular ammo		DV+0		AP+0			(per 10 rounds)	20¥	Licence Restricted*

Also called ball or full metal jacket rounds, these solid slugs are useful for numerous applications (mainly killing things).

*Subsonic ammo		DV+0		AP+0			(per 10 rounds)	40¥	Forbidden Legality*

Subsonic ammunition features a lighter charge and a slightly smaller bullet than regular rounds. This slows the bullet’s muzzle velocity below the speed of sound, reducing the sound of the weapon being fired and making it easier to silence. Subsonic ammunition applies a -1 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the firing position. This dice pool modifier increases to -6 if a silencer or sound suppressor is used (replacing the usual -4 bonus from silencers or sound suppressors). Increase all penalties due to range by 1.

*Taser Darts		DV+0		AP+0				(each)	5¥	Legal*

These darts are designed to be loaded into taser weapons.

*Spare Clip	[Not ammo, but you probably want it to hold the ammo]		5¥	Legal*

A spare clip comes unloaded by can hold the maximum rounds for the weapon. Each clip is specific to the weapon you buy it for. And yes, it’s technically a detachable box magazine, but the Cityspeak word for it is so popular these days that even the catalogs call them clips.
### **Firearm Accessories**

*Bipod			[Under Mount]						200¥	Legal*

This two-legged brace extends downward from the weapon, allowing it to be fired low to the ground with the user in a prone or sitting position. A bipod can be attached to the underbarrel mount of a weapon and provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a bipod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying a bipod is a Simple Action. Removing it is a Complex Action. *Wireless*: Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Bonus Action.

*Electronic Firing	[Barrel Mount]						1,000¥	Licence Restricted*

With this modification, most of the weapon’s moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet’s propellant. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation and a -1 dice pool penalty to sound-based Perception Tests when trying to locate where the weapon is being fired from. Electronic firing is usually combined with trigger removal to further reduce the number of moving parts, but this is not mandatory. The weapon still includes a loading mechanism that moves the bullet into the chamber, and it requires caseless ammunition.

*Extended Clip									35¥	Legal*

Sometimes the job calls for the ability to fire more shots without taking time to reload. That is what an extended clip is for. A Rating 1 Extended Clip adds 50% more rounds to the gun’s capacity and a Rating 2 Extending Clip adds 100% more rounds. The downside is that it makes the gun a bit harder to hide (+1 Concealability per Rating). More of an accessory that a modification, an Extended Clip does not use any modification slots.

*Flashlight		[Top or Under Mount]*

Standard Flashlight								25¥	Legal

Low-Light Flashlight								25¥	Legal

Thermographic Flashlight							25¥	Legal

By 2075, most flashlights are long lasting and super bright. Durability and brightness depend on the size – the bulkier, the better. Flashlights are also available in low-light and infrared versions, reducing visibility modifiers for low-light and thermographic vision, respectively. A flashlight can also be mounted to a weapon’s top or under-barrel mount.

*Folding Stock		[Stock Mount]							Legal*

Standard									30¥

Motorised									100¥

This is a stock. That folds into the weapon. Got it? It provides 1 point of recoil compensation – but only, of course, when it is out and braced against the user’s shoulder. It must be installed in the stock slot and requires a Simple Action to move in or out. There is a motorised version that makes folding an unfolding it a Bonus Action with a DNI. When extended, the Concealability Rating is increased by 2.

*Gas-vent System	[Barrel Mount]*

*Gas-vent System*		(Rating 1)						200¥	Licence Restricted

*Improved Gas-vent System*	(Rating 2)						400¥ 	Licence Restricted

*Expert Gas-vent System*		(Rating 3)						600¥	Licence Restricted

Gas-vent recoil compression systems are barrel-mounted accessories that vent a weapon’s barrel gases at a specific vector to counter muzzle climb. Once installed, a gas-vent cannot be removed. Gas-vent systems provide a number of points of Recoil Compensation equal to their rating.

*Guncam*			(Rating 1)						350¥	Licence Restricted

*Guncam*			(Rating 2)						500¥ 	Licence Restricted

*Guncam*			(Rating 3)						650¥	Licence Restricted

The device that launched a thousand stupid-ass MeFeed videos. Whatever the gun is pointing at, it records. Yeah, you don’t always want a recording of what you’re about to shoot but sometimes that footage is invaluable – whether you need to show Mr. Johnson what you managed to pull off, review footage to help you plan your next move or doctor what you filmed to make you look good, the video you film has plenty of possible uses. Its Device Rating fills in for any necessary stats. Guncams can be installed in the Top, Under, Barrel, Side or Internal slots.

*Hidden Arm Slide	[Accessory]						600¥	Licence Restricted*

Attached to the forearm and worn under clothing, this slide can accommodate a hold-out, light pistol or taser. With a hand gesture, the slide releases the weapon right into your hand. If you quick draw the weapon in this slide, the threshold for a quick draw is 2. It also gives the weapon a -1 Concealability modifier. *Wireless*: You can ready the weapon in the slide as a Bonus Action.

*Holographic Sight	[Top Mount]						200¥	Legal*

Offers the same benefits as a laser sight without the red trail of light giving away the position of the shooter. In addition, the holographic (or holo) sight can display basic information such as range to target or remaining ammo without the wielder using AR. The only downside is the necessary top mount sometimes gets in the way, making quick draw attempts require 1 extra success.

*Holster, Concealable	[Accessory]						150¥	Legal*

This small holster can be worn on the ankle, clipped to the forearm, in the small of the back, or anywhere else it’s unlikely to be seen. The concealable holster adds -1 to the item’s Concealability. Only hold-outs, light pistols and tasers fit in a Concealable Holster.

*Holster, Quick-draw	[Accessory]						200¥	Legal*

This easy access holster can hold a weapon of light pistol or smaller size. It reduces the threshold for quick-drawing the holstered weapon by 1.

*Holster, Concealable Quick-draw	[Accessory]				500¥	Legal*

What more do you want a holster to do? You get to reduce the Concealability modifier of your weapon by 1 while the threshold to quick-draw a holstered weapon drops by 1. It won’t fire the thing for you though, so buckle down and do it yourself. Only hold-outs, light pistols and tasers fit in a Concealable Quick-draw Holster.

*Imaging Scope		[Top Mount]						300¥	Legal*

These classic scopes are attached to the top mount; attaching or removing them takes only a Simple Action. Imaging scopes include a micro camera and vision magnification and they have a Capacity of 3 to hold vision enhancements. *Wireless*: The scope’s vision can be shared, allowing you to share what your scope sees with your team (and yourself if you’re using it to look around a corner).

*Laser Sight		[Top or Under-barrel Mount]				125¥	Legal*

This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colours) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Use Device Action.

*Longbarrel		[Barrel Mount]						300¥	Licence Restricted*

This modification involves replacing the stock barrel with a longer one thereby increasing bullet velocity. Increase Accuracy by 1, while increasing the Concealability modifier by +1.

*Retractable Bayonet	[Under-barrel Mount]					200¥	Legal*

This modification adds an underbarrel sheath that conceals a retractable bayonet. The bayonet can be extended as a Use Device Action. When attached to a Longarms weapon and extended, it has Reach 2, DV (STR+1)P and AP -1. If attached to a Pistol, the Reach is 1.

*Sawed Off/Shortbarrel	[Barrel Mount]						20¥	Licence Restricted*

This common modification reduced damage by 1 but increases Concealability by 1. It eliminates the gun’s ability to mount barrel modifications. If combined with stock removal, the Accuracy is also reduced by 1 in addition to the other benefits and penalties listed. Can only be used on Heavy Pistols and weapons in the Longarms skill group.

*Silencer/Suppressor	[Barrel Mount]						500¥	Forbidden Legality*

This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound and flash of a weapon’s discharge. It cannot be used with revolvers or shotguns. It applies a -4 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Complex Action.

*Shock Pad		[Stock Mount]						50¥	Legal*

A shock-absorbing pad is situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun or heavy weapon and provides 1 point of recoil compensation.

*Speed Loader		[Accessory]						25¥	Legal*

The speed loader is a simple device that holds a ring of bullets for fast insertion into a revolver’s cylinder. Each speed loader is specific to the weapon it was designed for. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Complex Action instead of having to load rounds one at a time, loading only (Agility) rounds as a Complex Action.

*Stock Removal		[Stock Mount]						20¥	Legal*

Removing the stock reduces both the recoil compensation and the Concealability of a gun by 1. Weapon modifications such as a shock pad or any other stock modifications cannot be applied. If combined with sawed off the Accuracy is also reduced by 1 in addition to the other benefits and penalties listed.

*Trigger Removal								50¥	Legal*

Sometimes the time it takes to move a finger is too long. Sometimes the pressure of squeezing a trigger is enough to throw off the precision of a long range shot. This is the modification for those times. A smartgun system is necessary for trigger removal, singe the gun requires a command delivered wirelessly or through an optical cable to fire. This modification adds +1 Accuracy but is not cumulative with any other modification that adds to Accuracy other than the requisite smartlink. Wireless triggering requires wireless to be turned on. In case you were wondering.
#### **Sidebar: Quick Draw**
A character may attempt to quick-draw a pistol, pistol-sized weapon or small throwing weapon and immediately fire it by using a Quick Draw Simple Action. For a character to successfully draw the weapon, the player must make a (Weapon Skill) + Reaction [Physical] (3) Test. If the test is successful, the character draws the weapon and fires as a single Simple Action. If the test fails, the weapon is drawn but cannot be fired with the same action. If there is a glitch, the weapon is stuck in the holster or dropped and no more actions are allowed. In a critical glitch, a drawn blade may be fumbled out of the character’s reach or a pistol accidentally fired while still in the holster; the gamemaster decides the exact nature of the screw-up. Two weapons may be quick-drawn and fired simultaneously, but the dice pool is split and off-hand penalties apply.
### **Grenades**
Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Use the Throwing Weapons skill when throwing grenades or Heavy Weapons when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher.

*Flash-bang	DV 10S AP-4							100¥	Licence Restricted*

Upon detonation, these “concussion” or “stun” grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast distributed equally over a radius of 10 metres.

*Gas								Chemical Cost+	40¥	Licence Restricted*

Instead of exploding, the gas grenade releases a cloud of gas over an area with a radius of 10 metres. This is usually riot control/CS gas, but many other chemical or toxin payloads can be chosen.

### **Misc Equipment**

*Bug Scanner, Handheld									Licence Restricted*

*Rating 1										100¥*

*Rating 2										200¥*

*Rating 3										300¥*

Also called a radio signal scanner, this device locates and locks in wireless devices within 20 metres. The scanner can also measure a signal’s strength and pinpoint its location. To operate a bug scanner, roll Electronic Warfare + Logic [Rating]. A device that is running silent can use its Firewall [Firewall] to defend against the scan. If you get any net hits at all, you find the device. You may substitute the scanner’s Rating for your Electronic Warfare skill when you use it.

*Cyberware Scanner, Handheld								Licence Restricted*

*Rating 1										100¥*

*Rating 2										200¥*

*Rating 3										300¥*

Cyberware scanners, also known as millimetre wave detection systems, process video taken in the millimetre wave spectrum to identify the energy signature of cyberware and concealed items (specifically weapons) on a person. These devices can “see through” thick layers of clothing and other concealment to identify items from a distance of up to fifteen metres away. To determine if the detector scans cyberware or a prohibited item, roll twice the Rating of the scanner (and any dice pool modifier from the table below) and compare the hits scored to the thresholds given on the Cyberware Scanner Table. Millimetre wave scans can detect any non-biological item by its shape and composition, assuming the item is listed in the device’s database. If the threshold is reached, the scanner detects the item/implant and notes its general locations and type; additional hits provide more detail (function, model, grade, etc.).

|**Cyberware Scanner Table**||

*Flare Compensation							1 Cap		250¥	Legal*

This protects you from blinding flashes of light as well as simple glare. It mitigates the vision modifiers for glares and reduces the penalty from flashing lights.

*Image Link								1 Cap		25¥	Legal*

A standard upgrade, this lets you display visual information (text, pictures, movies, the current time, etc.) in your field of vision. This is usually AROs, but you can display pretty much whatever you want to on it. You and your team can use it to share tactical and situational info in real time. An image link is what you need to truly “see” AR and participate in the modern world.

*Low-Light Vision							1 Cap		500¥	Legal*

This allows you to see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness, though.

*Polychromic Lens (Contacts only)					1 Cap		100¥	Legal*

This feature can be added to contacts and allows an individual to change the apparent colour and pattern of their retina. The contacts can be changed via wireless connection to any appearance imaginable, though the resolution is not as precise as Retinal Duplication cyberware and cannot fool a biometric reader.

*Smartlink								1 Cap		2,000¥	Restricted Licence*

This accessory interacts with a smartgun system to project the weapon’s angle of fire into the user’s vision, centring red crosshairs where the user is pointing and highlighting perceived targets. The smartgun’s laser rangefinder also calculates and displays the distance to the target. Additional data from the weapon, such as the ammunition level, heat buildup and stress can also be displayed. Requires an Image Link.

*Thermographic Vision							1 Cap		500¥	Legal*

This enables vision in the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately and so on.

*Vision Enhancement										Legal*

*Rating 1									1 Cap		500¥*

*Rating 2									1 Cap		1,000¥*

*Rating 3									1 Cap		1,500¥*

This sharpens a character’s vision at all ranges, providing visual acuity closer to that of the average hawk than that of the average metahuman. It adds its Rating as a dice pool modifier to your visual Perception Tests and their Limit.

*Vision Magnification							1 Cap		250¥	Legal*

This zoom function digitally magnifies vision up to fifty times, allowing distant targets to be seen clearly. After using a Take Aim action, you reduce the Range modifier by one category.
### **Electronic Accessories**

*AR Gloves	(Device Rating 3)							150¥	Legal*

AR gloves allow you to manually interact with the Matrix in Augmented Reality mode, letting you “touch” and “hold” virtual AROs and receiving tactile force-feedback.

Plain grey gloves in a “one-size-fits-all” size that allow AR manipulation.

*AR Nails		(Device Rating 1)						200¥	Legal*

Synthetic fingernails that function the same as AR gloves.

*Biometric Reader	(Device Rating 3)						200¥	Legal*

Sometimes someone online likes to know it’s really you. This handheld device can be used for fingerprints, retina scans, voice patterns, tongue prints – pretty much anything but a DNA scan. You can use it to lock your electronics so only you (or one of your body parts) can unlock it.

*Datachip										5¥	Legal*

For occasions when you want to transfer data by physical means – like bringing the project specs on the competition’s new cyberdeck to Mr Johnson in person at the meet – a datachip can hold enormous quantities of data in a small finger-sized chip, accessible to any electronic device. Datachips have no wireless capability, so you need to plug them into a universal data connector (found on any device) if you want to read or write to them.

*Electronic Paper	(Device Rating 1)						5¥	Legal*

This electronic sheet is anywhere from post-it note to poster sized and it can be folded or rolled up. It digitally displays images, text, data or video and can act as a touchscreen. Electronic paper is wireless and can be written on or erased wirelessly. Sometimes hacker gangs cover the surfaces of buildings in electronic paper so they are constantly changing and overwritten with graffiti that can be seen even by people with their AR image-links turned off.

*Hitcher Jack										250¥	Legal*

This cyberdeck attachment allows non-cybered companions to accompany a decker into the Matrix. They can view the Matrix as the decker views it but cannot interact with it.

*RFID												Legal*

These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

`	`*Security Tags							10¥	Legal*

Security-conscious megacorps often implant these security tags in their sararimen and valued citizens, either to monitor employee workplace productivity, grant and deny clearance and security access or track employees in the case of abduction or extraction (or escape). These same tags are used on incarcerated and paroled criminals and parents and schools also use them to track students. Security tags cannot be simply erased with a tag eraser due to EMP hardening. If a tag is implanted under the skin, an Extended Medicine + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 minute) Test is needed to remove it.

`	`*Sensor Tags							40¥	Legal*

A sensor RFID can be equipped with a single sensor (sold separately) of up to Rating 2. It then records everything it can, to a maximum of 24 hours of time, at which point it can be programmed to either shut off or overwrite data older than 24 hours. Sensor tags are often used for diagnostic purposes in various devices.

*Stealth Tags							20¥	License Restricted*

A stealth tag always runs in hidden mode and usually has a Stealth Rating equal to its Device Rating. Stealth tags are often used as backup for security tags by megacorps that are security conscious (and sneaky). They can be implanted the same way security tags can.

*Simrig			(Device Rating 3)						1,000¥	Legal*

This simsense recorder can record experience data (sensory and emotive) from you or whoever is wearing it. Simrigs are used to make the most of the simsense chips sold on the market. You’ll need to have a working sim module (with the DNI interface) to make a recording.

*Subvocal Microphone	(Device Rating 1)						50¥	Legal*

The next best thing to telepathy is the ability to stage-whisper at any range. Attached with adhesive to your throat, this hard-to-spot microphone lets you communicate via subvocalized speech. A -4 dice pool modifier is applied to Perception Tests to overhear you when you’re subvocalizing.

*Tag Eraser										450¥	Licence Restricted*

This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other small, unshielded electronics. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimetres of an electronic device and activate it, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The tag eraser has one charge but can be full recharged at a power point in 10 seconds.

*Trid Projector		(Device Rating 3)						200¥	Legal*

This device projects a trideo hologram into a five-meter cube right next to or above the device. The hologram can be quite realistic, but unless you’re really artistic about it, it’s pretty obvious that it’s just trid.

*White Noise Generator										Legal*

*Rating 1											50¥*

*Rating 2											100¥*

*Rating 3											150¥*

*Rating 4											200¥*

*Rating 5											250¥*

*Rating 6											300¥*

This device creates a field of random noise, masking the sounds within its area and preventing direct audio surveillance. All Perception Tests to overhear a conversation within (Rating) meters of a white noise generator receive a dice pool penalty equal to twice the device’s Rating. If more than one generator is in use, only count the highest rating. A white noise generator is redundant in a noisy environment (such as a nightclub or a firefight) and does not help to curtail video surveillance or jam wireless signals.

The medkit includes medical supplies, bandages, tools, and a (talkative) doctor expert system that can advise the user on techniques to handle most typical medical emergencies (including fractures, gunshot wounds, chemical wounds and poisoning, as well as offering advice for the treating of shock, handling blood loss, and of course performing resuscitations). Add the medkit’s rating to your dice pool on First Aid tests. The medkit needs to be restocked after every (Rating uses).

*Biomonitor										300¥	Legal*

This compact device measures life signs – heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and so on. The biomonitor can also analyse blood, sweat and skin samples. Used by medical services and patients who need to monitor their own health, biomonitors can be worn as an armband or wristband or integrated into clothing or commlinks. Attaching a biomonitor is a Simple Action.
#### **Slap Patches**
Slap patches are adhesive dermal chemical dispensers that allow continual, safe administration of chemicals. They are applied directly to the patient’s skin. Applying a slap patch to an unwilling patient’s requires a successful melee attack (which deals no damage), which may be tricky if the target doesn’t have much exposed skin. Applying a slap patch is a Simple Action.

*Rating 2											50¥*

*Rating 3											750¥*

*Rating 4											100¥*

*Rating 5											125¥*

*Rating 6											150¥*

This patch removes a number of boxes of Stun damage equal to its Rating. This effect lasts for (Rating x 10) minutes – after that period of time the patient takes (Rating +1) unresisted Stun damage (which may become physical overflow by that point). While the stimulant patch is in effect, the character is unable to rest. Frequent use of stimulant patches may require Addiction Tests. Treat it as Addiction Rating 2, Addiction Threshold 1.

*Trauma Patch										500¥	Legal*

If placed on a dying patient, this allows them to make an immediate stabilisation test using Body + Willpower (3). If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage. Additional stabilisation tests can be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

*Tranq Patch (Rating 1-10)	Rating x 20¥*

This patch inflicts Stun damage equal to its rating, resisted with Body.

*Vasotech Autoinjection Gun									Legal*

The Vasotech Multidose Autoinjector System is a favourite among military and civilian combat medics. These compact handheld devices resemble a pistol. When pressed against a subject’s skin, the autoinjector rapidly sterilised a small field and administers an injection from a multidose drug reservoir. The MD-9 model features a single larger reservoir that stores up to nine doses, whereas the newer MD-3X model features three smaller reservoirs, each of which holds up to three doses. In game terms, an autoinjector allows a medic to administer an injectable drug with a Simple Action. Changing reservoirs with the MD-3X requires a Use Device Action.

### **Drugs**

*Aztech Chew									10¥	Legal*

Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation

Speed: 1 minute

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 2 (2)]

Effect: +1 Reaction, Pain Resistance 1

This legal drug first gained popularity in the early days of the Native American Nations and is traditionally made from an ancient formula including tobacco leaves, cannabis resin and willow bark. Modern aztech chew typically forgoes the expensive natural ingredients by directly combining the active chemical compounds involved: THC, nicotine and salicin. Aztech chew users claim the drug has a calming effect. Once the effect wears off, users experience -1 Intuition for a time period equivalent to twice the original duration. Some claim that long-term users are more susceptible to fatigue and cancer.

*Betel										5¥	Legal*

Vector: Ingestion

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1D6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological [Special]

Effect: +1 Perception

An ancient and widespread Asian practice of chewing nuts and leaves of the betel tree with lime has led to the synthesis of Wuxing’s highly addictive and legal betel chewing gum. Betel is a mild stimulant with cavity-fighting properties; users commonly feel awake and alert when using it. Rather than making an Addiction Test, characters who use betel, even once, gain a Mild addiction to it. A character may never have an addiction worse than Mild to betel. Characters who add dice to toxin resistance tests are immune to this effect if they succeed at a Toxin Resistance Test. Because it is instantly addictive, betel often serves as a gateway drug to more powerful stimulants.

*Bliss										30¥	Forbidden Legality*

Vector: Inhalation, Injection

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Duration: (6-Body) hours, minimum 1 hour

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 5 (3)]

Effect: -1 Reaction, +1 to all thresholds, -1 to all Limits, High Pain Tolerance 3

A tranquilising narcotic, bliss is an opiate synthesised from poppy plants. It takes its name from the sensations its users feel.

*Brass Balls									60¥	Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: Immediate

Duration: (12-Body) hours, minimum 1 hour

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 5 (3)]

Effect: Immunity to Fear (see below)

This drug suppresses the functions of the brain that govern fear, both innate and learned. For the duration of the drug’s effects, the character is immune to fear (including negative results from Composure Tests) and fear-based powers/attacks. As a drawback, however, the character becomes reckless, incautious and also less inhibited. At the gamemaster’s discretion, they may call for the character to make a Logic + Willpower (3) Test to avoid doing something that would normally be considered foolish, dangerous or socially inappropriate.

*Cram										20¥	Restricted Licence*

Vector: Ingestion, Inhalation

Speed: 10 minutes

Duration: (12-Body) hours, minimum 1 hour

Addiction Type: Psychological [Rating 4 (3)]

Effect: +1 Reaction, +1D6 Initiative Dice

Cram is an extremely popular stimulant. When this drug wears off, users crash and suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). Cram users appear hyper-alert, almost to the point of paranoia. They react quickly, often without thought and they’re prone to irrational outbursts. Other common side effects are jitteriness and fidgeting.

*Crash										800¥	Legal*

Vector: Injection

Speed: Immediate

Power: Special

Addiction Type: None

Effect: Special

Crash is an injectable form of the potent vasoactive and stimulant drugs found in a trauma patch. When given intravenously, crash allows the subject to make a Stabilisation Test using Body + Willpower (3). If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage. Additional stabilisation tests can be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

*Jazz										75¥	Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 8 (3)]

Effect: +1 Reaction, +1 Physical Limit, +2D6 Initiative Dice

Jazz is a stimulant designed to better the odds for run-of-the-mill law-enforcement officers who run up against augmented street samurai. It’s usually taken from a single-dose inhaler (or “popper”) When jazz wears off, the user crashes and is flooded with despondent and miserable emotions, suffering the effects of Disorientation for a duration equal to the duration of the initial effects. While cram makes people hyper and twitchy, jazz makes people as jumpy and hyper as caffeinated two-year-olds.

*Kamikaze									100¥	Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological [Rating 9 (3)]

Effect: +1 Body, +1 Agility, +2 Strength, +1 Willpower, +2 Physical Limit, +2D6 Initiative Dice, High Pain Tolerance 3

Kamikaze is a tailored combat stimulant. When kamikaze wears off, the user crashes and suffers -1 Reaction, -1 Willpower and -2 to all Limits for a duration equal to that of the initial effect. They also suffer 6 Stun damage (unresisted). The repeated use of kamikaze has a destructive effect on the user’s metabolism. Large doses can cause excitement, tremors, momentary euphoria and dilated pupils. Excess doses (bordering on overdose level) cause anxiety, hallucinations and uncontrolled muscular movements. Even higher dosages lead to death. Kamikaze users are near-crazed, filled with a feeling of imperviousness and invincibility, exhibiting almost no regard for their own well-being. They can be entertaining to watch, as long as you’re not in front of them.

*Long Haul									50¥	Legal*

Vector: Injection

Speed: 10 minutes

Duration: 4 days

Addiction Type: Psychological [Rating 2 (1)]

Effect: Alleviates need for sleep

A combination of synthesised hormones and other brain-regulating chemicals, long haul stimulates the brain and keeps the user awake, obviating the need for sleep. A character dosed on long haul can remain awake for four days – without incurring any modifiers from fatigue or weariness. After this time, however, the user immediately passes out and sleeps soundly for 8D6 hours. If the character is kept awake during this period, he suffers from disorientation as he is afflicted with hallucinations and an inability to concentrate. If a second dose of long haul is taken after the first has worn off, the character can stay awake an additional 1D6 /2 days. After that period, they suffer 10 Stun damage (unresisted) and must crash as detailed above. Long haul cannot keep a character awake past this point, no matter how many additional doses are administered.

*Nitro										50¥	Restricted Licence*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Physiological & Psychological [Rating 9 (3)]

Effect: +2 Strength, +2 Willpower, +2 Perception, +2 Physical Limit, High Pain Tolerance 6

A dangerous combination of potent drugs favoured by troll gangers, nitro is a powerful stimulant that can easily kill a user. After the drug’s effects wear off, the subject suffers -2 to all limits and takes 9 Stun damage (unresisted) for an equal duration. Nitro users feel infused with energy, suffer a diminished attention span and talk incessantly (even to themselves).

*Ondansetron									50¥	Legal*

Vector: Ingestion, Injection

Speed: Immediate

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: None

Effect: Counteracts the effects of Nausea

Ondansetron is a powerful anti-emetic drug that works rapidly on the central nervous system to relieve nausea.

Duration: 10 x 1d6 minutes

Addiction Type: Psychological [Rating 3 (1)]

Effect: -2 Reaction, +1 Willpower, -1 physical action dice pool penalty

A psychedelic hallucinogen, zen is popular among those looking to escape reality or seeking trance-like states.
### **Toxins**
Knockout drugs. Truth serum. Nerve gas. All of these are examples of toxins, a catch-all term for a substance that’s mostly meant for use as a weapon, as opposed to recreation. Each substance has several attribute ratings.

*CS/Tear Gas									20¥	Restricted Legality*

Vector: Contact, Inhalation

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Penetration: 0

Power: 8

Effect: Disorientation, Nausea, Stun Damage

CS gas is an irritant that affects the eyes, skin and mucus membranes, causing them to burn to water. It also stimulates a physiological panic response: increased heart rate, shortness of breath and so forth. Washing thoroughly with soap and water can remove CS from the victim’s skin, thus ending the duration of the nausea prematurely. CS gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.

*Narcoject									50¥	Restricted Legality*

Vector: Injection

Speed: Immediate

Penetration: 0

Power: 15

Effect: Stun Damage

A common tranquiliser, narcoject is typically used with dart guns. It has no side effects.

*Nausea Gas									25¥	Restricted Legality*

Vector: Inhalation

Speed: 3 Combat Turns

Penetration: 0

Power: 9

Effect: Disorientation, Nausea

Used as a riot control agent, this gas causes nausea and a crippling need to vomit. Nausea gas becomes inert after two minutes of contact with the air.

*Pepper Punch									5¥	Legal*

Vector: Contact, Inhalation

Speed: 1 Combat Turn

Penetration: 0

Power: 11

Effect: Nausea, Stun Damage

Pepper punch is an irritant combining CS and oleo-capsicum, the active ingredient in hot peppers, along with other chemicals. It is typically deployed as a liquid spray for personal defence and deterrence; this agent is often tagged with RFID tags or special dyes to identify victims later. Someone dosed with pepper punch feels an intense burning on any affected skin; this effect is even more pronounced if it gets in the eyes, nose or mouth. Victims sprayed in the eyes have trouble seeing and breathing becomes difficult.

===============================================
### **Cyberdecks**
If you were a decker and someone swung a monofilament claymore at you, you’d protect your cyberdeck with your body and not the other way around. This isn’t just because the things are fraggin’ expensive – cyberdecks (or decks) are a decker’s life’s blood, an all-in-one ticket to hacking the planet. The most common form of a deck is a smooth, flat, elongated rectangle, slim with plenty of display space for touch controls, although they can take many forms.

All cyberdecks include illegal hot-sim modules right out of the box.

It can act like a commlink and has all the features of a commlink in addition to the cool hacking stuff.

*Radio Shack PCD-500						19,200¥			Licence Restricted*

*Response 1	Signal 1	Firewall 1	System 1		Processor Limit 2	Matrix Condition 7*

*Response 4	Signal 4	Firewall 3	System 3		Processor Limit 6	Matrix Condition 10*

*Programs: Analyse 2, Browse 3, Command 3, Edit 2*

This cyber-chariot allows deckers to ride out in confidence and style. At least, that’s what the advertising promises. In reality, it is an effective deck for the budget conscious managing small sites. Powerful enough to dump any script-kiddies who are playing in your turf, but lacking the power to battle master deckers, who probably wouldn’t be after data in the kind of system you’re guarding anyway.

*Novatech Navigator						119,200¥		Licence Restricted*

*Response 5	Signal 4	Firewall 5	System 4		Processor Limit 8	Matrix Condition 10*

*Programs: Analyse 4, Browse 5, Command 3, Edit 4*

This cyberdeck was built with its purpose in mind. If offers speed, power and protection, while cutting down on areas more important to riggers that deckers, such as signal and command programs. The decker with a Novatech Navigator and true skill can navigate through hosts and slice ice with the big boys.

*Renraku Tsurugi						139,650¥		Licence Restricted*

*Response 5	Signal 5	Firewall 5	System 5		Processor Limit 8	Matrix Condition 11*

*Programs: Analyse 5, Browse 5, Command 4, Edit 5*

While released as the better, faster, stronger competitor with the Novatech Navigator, this cyberdeck didn’t gain the market lead its creators hoped for. While critics acknowledge that it is overall a more powerful deck that many of its rivals, it also has a price that’s higher as well. The question raised by critics is whether all the features will be utilised by the typical user and, if not, whether it’s worth paying the premium for them?

*Shiawase Cyber-4						159,650¥		Licence Restricted*

*Response 6	Signal 5	Firewall 5	System 5		Processor Limit 9	Matrix Condition 11*

*Programs: Analyse 4, Browse 5, Command 5, Edit 5*

The first product of Shiawase’s reboot of the Fuchi Cyber line, the Cyber-5, was a deck that had high praise but low sales figures, criticised for being out of reach of the larger cybersecurity market. The Cyber-4 was introduced as a low-price, high-performance cyberdeck, undercutting the price point of the CIY-720 while outperforming the more popular cyberdeck in some areas. This model will save you a lot of money but has its own flaws. Tread carefully. 

*XIAO MPG-1							172,650¥		Licence Restricted*

*Response 6	Signal 6	Firewall 5	System 5		Processor Limit 10	Matrix Condition 12*

*Programs: Analyse 5, Browse 5, Command 4, Edit 5*

The MPG-1 is designed by our friends at the Midwest Pirate’s Guild with one deadly purpose: smash everything in your way before it can hit back. Lots of IC was harmed in the making of this deck.

*Sony CIY-720							173,100¥		Licence Restricted*

*Response 5	Signal 6	Firewall 5	System 6		Processor Limit 10	Matrix Condition 12*

*Programs: Analyse 5, Browse 6, Command 4, Edit 6*

This cyberdeck filled a high-end niche at the time with strong performance and a price point midway between its competitors. However, with the almost simultaneous release of the Shiawase Cyber-4 just undercutting the price, sales dropped significantly below predictions. While the timing was suspicious, that’s the way of the free market.

*Global Sandstorm Sirocco					186,250¥		Licence Restricted*

*Response 6	Signal 5	Firewall 6	System 6		Processor Limit 10	Matrix Condition 13*

*Programs: Analyse 6, Browse 5, Command 5, Edit 5*

*Hardening: 1*

The Sirocco was based on designs by Sandstorm Engineering before the merger with Global Oil to form Global Sandstorm. It became the peak of security spider anti-decker tech in the middle east.
### **Control Rig**
This implant harnesses the raw data-co-ordinating and synchronisation power of the middle brain for the express purpose of directly manipulating rigged vehicles and drones (and other devices with rigger interface, like turrets). It has a built-in sim module, so you can use it for DNI with other devices. It also comes with a universal data connector and about a meter of retractable cable (it’s like getting a free datajack). When you’re jumped into a vehicle or drone, the control rig provides its Rating as a dice pool bonus on all Vehicle skill tests. Additionally, the rating of your control rig is added to the Handling and Acceleration of any vehicle you are jumped into. As if that was not enough, your Vehicle Test thresholds are reduced by the rating of your control rig (to a minimum of 1), even when you’re jumped in.

*Control Rig										Licence Restricted*

### **Rigger Command Console (RCC)**
A deck for controlling drones, vehicles and security systems. It’s about the size of a briefcase. The main purpose of the RCC is to create a PAN with your drones. If a drone is slaved to a rigger command console and isn’t running any of its own programs, it uses the programs running on the RCC. This can exceed its normal program limit.

It can act like a commlink and has all the features of a commlink in addition to the cool drone stuff.

A mix of Edit and Browse subroutines, Corrupt programs are designed to track down and demolish specific information in a node without actually deleting the files in which they are saved. The idea is that, since deleted files can be restored from back-ups, Corrupt edits the files to overwrite the targeted information while leaving the file intact, without making any indication of the alteration, so that the corrupted file is eventually backed up as well, making detection and recovery of the original more difficult.

Stealth is a clever hacker program that attempts to hide the hacker from other system processes. While it cannot make an icon completely undetectable, it makes the hacker seem innocuous by obfuscating their activities, erasing system tracks and mimicking authorised traffic. While it is not used for any action, Stealth hides the hacker from detection by the Firewall as they break into a system, as well as from Matrix Perception tests and Trace User attempts.

Track programs systematically analyse a user’s connection and follow the datatrail back to the originating node. Track is commonly used as an intrusion countermeasure with the intent of identifying and locating a hacker or launching a counterattack, but it is also used to keep tabs on automated taxis and emergency service calls.
### **Custom Programs**

*Black Hammer								Forbidden Legality*

Rating 6							12,000¥

Black Hammer is a program that samples the command transactions between the target and their device and injects dangerous biofeedback responses into the target’s simsense interface. These aggravated signals may overload the target’s neural connections and in turn render them unconscious or cause death from stroke, heart failure, respiratory paralysis, aneurysm or neurotransmitter autotoxicity – and those are just a few of the possible effects. It is used with a Matrix Attack action.

*Blackout								Forbidden Legality*

Rating 6							9,000¥

Blackout is a non-lethal version of Black Hammer. It causes Stun damage to both hot sim and cold sim VR users. Like Black Hammer, it is used with the Matrix Attack action. It has no effect on programs, IC, sprites or AR users. Damage from Blackout does not overflow into the Physical Condition Monitor.

*Cat’s Paw								Forbidden Legality*

Rating 4							3,000¥

A low-offensive attack program that distracts the user instead of damaging the device they are using. Cat’s Paw is useful to prevent a user from performing Matrix actions while not bricking the device they may be using. This program fills the AR display or VR experience with annoying errors, spam pop-ups and pop-unders or other distracting garbage. On a successful Matrix Attack action, instead of doing damage, the program generates a negative dice pool penalty equal to 2 + the number of net hits on the Matrix Attack action.

Qi foci only work for adepts. They channel mana into your adept powers. A qi focus can be an object, like other foci, but can also be worked into a body modification, like tattoos, ritual scarring and piercings.

**<a name="_toc218024816"></a>AUGMENTATION**\

============================================
Cyberware and bioware augmentations are everywhere in 2075. For the rich, the poor and everyone in between, bodyshops on every street corner offer minor modifications at your convenience, legally and otherwise. Even the gang-bangers on those street corners might be equipped with cybernetic vision, hearing enhancements or datajacks. 
### **Cybersurgery and Recovery Time**
Getting cyberware and bioware installed hurts. When you have an augmentation implanted (after character creation), your Physical and Stun Condition Monitors each take damage from the procedure (more damage the more extensive and invasive the procedure). Most cyberclinics and body shops offer recovery rooms for patients to rest and heal up after cybersurgery but beware the sterility and cleanliness of the less-reputable chop shops.
### **Cyberware**
#### **Headware**
*Cyberskull									0.75 Essence	Legal*

*Obvious*								10,000¥		[4] Capacity

*Synthetic*							15,000¥		[2] Capacity

In fact, more of a shell than a full replacement, after all, the squishy parts inside aren’t being replaced. Cyberskulls can have other cyberwear installed within them. In addition, it provides an additional physical damage box on the Condition Monitor.

*Cyberskull, Partial								0.4 Essence	Legal*

*Obvious*								8,000¥		[4] Capacity

*Synthetic*							12,000¥		[2] Capacity

The partial cyberskull is another throwback classic that’s seeing a comeback. By upgrading one side of the skull with a large interface board, quite a few upgrades can be installed directly into it, rather than requiring difficult surgery repeatedly, but it is less invasive and far less dangerous than a full cyberskull.

*Datajack							1,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

A datajack gives you a direct neural interface (DNI), which can be handy in a lot of situations. It comes with a retractable spool of micro-cable (about a meter long) that lets you directly interface with any electronic device via a universal access cable. Datajacks are equipped with their own cache of storage memory for downloading or saving files. Two datajack users can string a fibreoptic cable between themselves to conduct a private mental communication immune to radio interception or eavesdropping. Most Use Device Actions can be triggered with a DNI Use Device Action instead (going from a Simple Action to a Bonus Action).

*[Alphaware] High Quality Datajack*			1,200¥		0.08 Essence	Legal

*Data Lock									0.1 Essence	Legal*

*Rating 1			(Firewall 1)*				1,000¥

*Rating 2			(Firewall 2)*				2,000¥

*Rating 3			(Firewall 3)*				3,000¥

*Rating 4			(Firewall 4)*				4,000¥

*Rating 5			(Firewall 5)*				5,000¥

*Rating 6			(Firewall 6)*				6,000¥

This special datajack is popular with couriers, spies, diplomatic aides and executive liaisons. Effectively, it turns the character in whom it is installed into a walking data safe. The data lock protects the data from anyone not authorised to access it (possibly including you). Data locks are not wireless enabled; they can only be accessed via universal data connector. In fact, the bearer of the implant doesn’t have mental access to the data – they’re only a carrier.

*False Face							20,000¥		0.5 Essence	Restricted Licence*

Intended for use by actors, shadowrunners quickly found other uses for the false face, resulting in it being restricted in most countries and corporations. The bones of the face are replaced with dozens of small ceramic plates that may be adjusted and rotated by micro-servos implanted beneath them. Combined with small reservoirs of gel that allow inflation or deflation of facial features, this allows the user to resculpt their face to a wide variety of versions possible with their metatype. False face provides a +4 dice pool bonus to a character’s Disguise Tests. Changing one’s face takes 1 minute of concentration and is somewhat painful.

*[Alphaware] Fine False Face*			25,000¥		0.4 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Smaller ceramic plates, more widely dispersed gel reservoirs and higher quality micro-servos but no reduction in the pain caused.*

*Fangs			STR(P)					200¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

*Fangs (Retractable)	STR(P)					500¥		0.15 Essence	Legal*

Fangs come in both retractable and non-retractable versions. Fangs are difficult to use as weapons – lower the user’s Physical Limit by 2 when trying to attack an aware target with fangs.

*[Alphaware] Tepes Retractable Fangs*			600¥		0.12 Essence	Legal

*For the true devotees.*

*Fibre-Optic Hair						100¥/10cm	0.1 Essence	Legal*

The original scalp hair (or facial hair) is removed and replaced with artificial hair composed of fibreoptic cabling. This hair is not only available in every imaginable colour, but is programmable, allowing for patterns, designs or scrolling effects that nature could never manage. From sparkling stars in a nightscape of black to an explosion of neon colours to a scrolling advert of your favourite hair salon, the only real limit is one’s imagination. Cost is based on length (to a maximum of 1m). The user may activate a downloaded colour pattern as a Use Device Action.

*[Alphaware] Fibre-Optic Hair*			120¥/10cm	0.08 Essence	Legal

*Now with in-built frizz control!*

*Horn Compartment						1,000¥		- Essence		Legal*

Similar to a tooth compartment but larger, the horn compartment gives a slick way to carry credsticks, RFID tags or other small items. As the with tooth compartment, it can be equipped to remove the enclosed items with either a wireless signal or a hidden catch.

*Horn Implants			STR(P)				400¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

*Horn Implants (Retractable)	STR(P)				1,000¥		0.15 Essence	Legal*

Synthetic horns come in a wide array of shapes and sizes, from curled troll horns to devil horns to single rhinoceros-style horns. Horns are usually installed in the skull, but some users implant rows of horns to form a “bone crest” along the head, neck and/or back. All horn implants are structurally braced for use in combat. Retractable “telescoping” models are also available to give users the advantage of surprise. Each two minor horns (similar to those of a goat) count as one implant, as do single larger horns (such as those of a rhinoceros or ram).

*Olfactory Booster								0.2 Essence	Legal*

*Rating 1*								4,000¥

*Rating 2*								8,000¥

*Rating 3*								12,000¥

*Rating 4*								16,000¥

This cybersnout enhances, identifies and records smells and can play them back later. The massively enhanced olfactory capabilities of a sniffer open up a while new world of sensory data to you – you’ll be able to sense things that ordinarily only a scent-hound would. You can smell people’s emotions in their sweat, traces of ammunition propellant, explosives or biological and chemical warfare compounds – the list goes on and on. A cut-off function allows you to completely ignore intense odours, possibly the most convenient feature for use in your daily life. Add the booster’s Rating as a dice pool modifier to your scent-based Perception Tests.

*[Alphaware] Hubert Olfactory Booster*		20,000¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Finer quality discernment of the high-end input with an even faster response time. For those who know that sometimes life is on the line.*

*Oral Slasher							750¥		0.25 Ess/3 Cap	Forbidden Legality*

A spool of pointed wire placed under the tongue, the oral slasher is more truthfully called the oral thruster, launched forward by compressed air to impale the target before being quickly rewound, not unlike a frog’s tongue, only more dangerous. With a range of only one metre, the slasher is a melee weapon covered by the Exotic Weapon Skill.

*Skilljack											Legal*

*Rating 1*								4,000¥		0.1 Essence

*Rating 2*								8,000¥		0.2 Essence

*Rating 3*								12,000¥		0.3 Essence

*Rating 4*								16,000¥		0.4 Essence

*Rating 5*								20,000¥		0.5 Essence

*Rating 6*								24,000¥		0.6 Essence

This headware interprets knowsofts and linguasofts for your brain so you can use them as though they were your own. It can also run activesofts but they only act similarly to Knowledge Skills unless you have skillwires. The total of all skills running on a skilljack cannot exceed its Rating x2 and the maximum Rating for a skill is the skilljack’s Rating. Starting skills from storage and stopping skills is a Bonus Action. You can’t use Edge with skills you have through a skilljack. If you have more than one skilljack, only one of them can operate at a time.

*Subvocal Microphone						250¥		0.05 Essence 	Legal*

The next best thing to telepathy is the ability to stage-whisper at any range. This implanted microphone lets you communicate via subvocalized speech. A -4 dice pool modifier is applied to Perception Tests to overhear you when you’re subvocalizing.

*Tooth Compartment						800¥		- Essence		Legal*

The oldest cyberware on the market, these hollow teeth come in storage and breakable models. The storage model is used to smuggle really, really tiny contraband, the size of a datachip or a really small RFID tag. Items can be removed with a wireless signal or hidden catch. The breakable model triggers a linked effect (such as starting a tracking signal or releasing deadly poison into your mouth – make sure you remember which is which!) with a wireless signal or it may trigger when you bite down hard on the tooth.

*Voice Amplifier							1,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

Go loud or go home. An in-built cybernetic amplifier for your voice. You can speak with an increased volume (up to 100 decibels) without strain.

*Voice Mask							2,000¥		0.1 Essence	Forbidden Legality*

A much-downgraded version of the voice modulator, the voice mask doesn’t allow for modification of the volume or frequency of the user’s voice, nor does it allow recording, rebroadcasting or replication of someone else’s voice. What it does, however, is use dissonant frequencies to totally distort the user’s voice and make it completely unrecognisable and useless for identification.

*Voice Modulator								0.2 Essence	Forbidden Legality*

*Rating 1*								5,000¥

*Rating 2*								10,000¥

*Rating 3*								15,000¥

*Rating 4*								20,000¥

This implant gives you perfect pitch and enormous vocal flexibility and distortion capabilities. You can speak with an increased volume (up to 100 decibels) without strain, shift your pitch to make perfect bird calls or mellifluous singing and, most importantly, uncanny vocal impressions. The modulator can also play back (and more or less perfectly imitate) a recorded or captured voice. Add the Rating of the modulator as a dice pool bonus for Impersonation Skill Tests.

#### **Eyeware**
*Cybereyes											Legal*

*Rating 1*				Capacity [4]*			2,500¥		0.2 Essence

*Rating 2*				Capacity [8]*			4,500¥		0.3 Essence

*Rating 3*				Capacity [12]*			8,500¥		0.4 Essence

*Rating 4*				Capacity [16]*			14,500¥		0.5 Essence

The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link at no extra cost, as well as capacity for vision enhancements.

`	`*Image Link*										Legal

A standard upgrade, this lets you display visual information (text, pictures, movies the current time, etc.) in your field of vision. This is usually AROs but you can display pretty much whatever you want on it. You and your team can use it to share tactical and situational info in real time. An image link is what you need to truly “see” AR and participate in the modern world.

*Eye Laser System						2,000¥		3 Cap		Legal*

This miniaturised laser system is only available for cybereyes and may be upgraded with additional functionality with some minor hardware adjustments and software upgrades. The basic eye laser system features a “look-to-talk” system, allowing the user to communicate and transmit information via infrared laser to another character with an eye laser system or external laser talk gear. The laser transmits through one eye and receives through the other. This communication system has the advantage of being discreet and, unlike wireless radio, is immune to jamming and interception. The lasers must be immobile and pointed towards each other and fog, smoke or other conditions may affect the transmission. The eye laser may also be used to scan barcodes and other optical glyphs.

*Eye Laser Microphone						1,500¥		2 Cap		Restricted Licence*

The eye laser microphone can be used for surveillance purposes. This bounces a laser beam against a solid object like a windowpane, reads the vibrational variations of the surface and translates them into the sounds that are occurring on the other side of the surface. Use a Perception + Intuition [Device Rating] Test. Maximum range is 100 metres.

*Eye Laser Rangefinder						1,000¥		1 Cap		Legal*

The eye laser rangefinder emits a laser beam that is reflected off a target’s surface and picked up by a detector to calculate the exact distance.

*Eye-Light System – White Light					500¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal*

The eye light system involves a pair of miniscule, high-power but low-heat lights installed into the user’s cybereyes. The mechanism is attached to the forward inner wall of the eye, with a second, smaller pupil installed to allow it to shine out. The light has a range of two meters and allow for a person with low-light vision to see for a range of ten times that. The thin beam illuminates an area roughly the size of a sheet of paper or half a fuse box, allowing for a wide range of activities while leaving the hands completely free. Activating or deactivating the eye light system is a Use Device Action.

`	`*Red – Nightvision Saving Light*				600¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal

Rather than standard white light, this version illuminates the area in a red, nightvision saving light that is harder to detect from a distance.

`	`*Ultraviolet Light*						750¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal

Ultraviolet light, invisible to regular sight lights the area. The ability to see in ultraviolet light is sold separately.

*Eye Recording Unit						1,500¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

This connects to the user’s optical nerves (or cybereye) and records all data directly into storage (accessible by the user’s PAN).

*Flare Compensation						1,000¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

This protects you from blinding flashes of light as well as simple glare. It mitigates the vision modifiers for glares and reduces the penalty from flashing lights.

*Low-Light Vision						1,000¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal*

This allows you to see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness, though.

*Microscopic Vision						1,500¥		0.2 Ess/3 Cap	Legal*

Take your lab with you, but don’t forget your slides! Microscopic lenses allow for refocusing of the eye to a massive magnification of tiny, tiny objects, up to 1000x their normal size. When microscopic lenses are active, the user’s eye is unsuitable for any other task but a Use Device Action allows the lens to be switched on or off. An item further away than 30 centimetres is beyond the focal ability of active microscopic lenses. When microscopic lenses are being used, in addition to the obvious use, they provide a +4 dice pool bonus on Perception tests to examine the material in question.

*Smartlink							3,000¥		0.2 Ess/3 Cap	Restricted Licence*

This accessory interacts with a smartgun system to project the weapon’s angle of fire into the user’s vision, centring red crosshairs where the user is pointing and highlighting perceived targets. The smartgun’s laser rangefinder also calculates and displays the distance to the target. Additional data from the weapon, such as the ammunition level, heat buildup and stress can also be displayed. Requires an Image Link.

`	`*Subdermal Induction Pad*					500¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Restricted Licence

Implanted in the palm, this allows the user to link with a smartgun system through their grip, rather than a hackable wireless connection.

*Thermographic Vision						1,500¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal*

This enables vision in the infrared spectrum, enabling you to see heat patterns. It’s a very practical way to spot living beings in areas of total darkness, to check if a motor or machine has been running lately and so on.

*Vision Enhancement										Legal*

*Rating 1**								4,000¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap

*Rating 2**								8,000¥		0.2 Ess/2 Cap

*Rating 3**								12,000¥		0.3 Ess/3 Cap

This sharpens a character’s vision at all ranges, providing visual acuity closer to that of the average hawk than that of the average metahuman. It adds its Rating as a dice pool modifier to your visual Perception Tests and their Limit.

*Vision Magnification						2,000¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal*

This zoom function digitally magnifies vision up to fifty times, allowing distant targets to be seen clearly. p177

#### **Earware**
*Cyberears											Legal*

*Rating 1*				Capacity [4]*			2,000¥		0.2 Essence

*Rating 2*				Capacity [8]*			5,000¥		0.3 Essence

*Rating 3*				Capacity [12]*			8,000¥		0.4 Essence

*Rating 4*				Capacity [16]*			11,000¥		0.5 Essence

Ordinarily, cyberears replace only the inner ear, although the whole thing can be replaced as well if you like. Cyberears offer hearing with normal ranges, a sound link and Capacity for modifications and enhancements.

`	`*Sound Link*

The sound link can play audio (recordings, movie soundtracks, music, etc.) from linked sources within the user’s PAN (or headware memory or datajack) directly into the user’s cyberears. A sound link is a common component of immersive AR environments, adding a sonic component.

*Antennae							500¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

With an extended antenna array, the user can send and receive wireless signals easier than without. Available in both retractable and fragile or non-retractable and sturdy options for the same cost, they are often, but not always, taken in pairs and come in a wide variety of designs, shapes and colours. The antenna array reduces Noise by 1 for the user.

*Audio Analyser							1,000¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

A simple bit of hardware that measures and identifies both pitch and timbre, audio analyser is quite useful for musicians and impersonators, but it can also allow eavesdropping of old touch-tone datapads. The audio analyser raises the Social limit by 1 for musical performances by the user.

*Audio Enhancement										Legal*

*Rating 1**								4,000¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap

*Rating 2**								8,000¥		0.2 Ess/2 Cap

*Rating 3**								12,000¥		0.3 Ess/3 Cap

Audio enhancement allows the user to hear a broader spectrum of audio frequencies, including high and low frequencies outside the normal metahuman audible spectrum. The user also experiences fine discrimination of nuances and can block out distracting background noise. Audio enhancement adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus and Limit.

*Balance Augmenter						5,000¥		0.1 Ess/4 Cap	Legal*

The balance augmenter enhances the inner ear’s natural balance mechanism. You receive a +1 dice pool bonus on all tests involving balance, such as climbing, walking across a narrow platform, landing after a jump and so on.

*Damper							2,000¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

This implant protects the user from sudden increases in sound as well as damaging sound levels. The damper adds a +2 dice pool bonus to resisting sonic attacks, including flashbangs.

*Increased Hearing Spectrum					2,000¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

A basic augmentation that expands the user’s hearing spectrum beyond the typical metahuman breadth of 20 Hz to 20 kHz as well as beyond typical audio enhancements. The user’s hearing extends as low as 5 Hz, into infrasonic sound and as high as 120 kHz into the ultrasonic. This allows the user to hear sounds outside the normal range, such as dog whistles or ultrasound-based motion detectors, which would otherwise go unnoticed. If combined with a device to create such sounds, such as a voice modulator, then a method of signalling or even communication can be employed that is difficult for those without the augmentation to listen in on.

*Sound Filter											Legal*

*Rating 1**								3,500¥		0.1 Essence/1 Cap

*Rating 2**								7,000¥		0.2 Essence/2 Cap

*Rating 3**								10,500¥		0.3 Essence/3 Cap

*Rating 4**								14,000¥		0.4 Essence/4 Cap

This lets you block out background noise and focus on specific sounds or patterns of sounds. It even includes speech, word and sound pattern recognition. Each Rating point lets you select a single sound group (such as the footsteps of a patrolling guard or the rotors of a distant helicopter) and focus on it. You only actively listen to one group at a time, but you can record the others for later playback or set them to triggered monitoring (such as sounding an alert if a conversation brings up a certain topic or if there’s a variation in the breathing pattern of a guard dog).

*Spatial Recogniser						4,000¥		0.1 Ess/2 Cap	Legal*

This hearing accessory pinpoints the source of a sound. You get a +2 dice pool bonus to your audio-based Perception Tests and their limit.

#### **Bodyware**

*Auto-Injector						500¥		0.05 Essence	Legal*

Originally, auto-injectors were devices that released medication into a person’s body either when needed or on a regular time schedule. It took the street about thirty seconds to realise that you could replace, say, insulin with combat drugs and suddenly you have a sneaky boosting technology. While the base auto-injector is designed to hold a single dose of a chemical, an auxiliary storage unit is often implanted to allow up to five additional doses. The auto-injector is normally refilled from an external port. Not that while different chemicals can’t be mixed in a single dispensary, multiple injectors may be implanted to create a veritable salad bar of chemical cocktails.

*Expanded Reservoir (+5 doses)*			250¥		0.05 Essence	Legal

*Balance Tail						2,000¥		0.25 Essence	Legal*

Largely having fallen out of favour for their bioware cousins, balance tails are cybernetic tails extended from the user’s spine, focused on improved stability and balance. The tail is controlled by a dedicated sub-processor at the base of the spine and is autonomous, often moving about on its own without the user’s awareness as it quietly compensates for natural motion. While the base tail is in the always-classic chrome, faux-fur cat tails are, by far, the dominant style. Tails must be at least knee-length to be functional, but most are slightly longer than the user’s legs.

The balance tail raises the user’s Physical limit by 1 for all tests requiring balance, such as climbing, jumping or running. It also raises the user’s Physical limit by one for purposes of resisting knockdown.

*Biomonitor						500¥		0.1 Ess/1 Cap	Legal*

While this is simply an implanted version of the standard biomonitor, its cybernetic natures allows it to integrate the user’s augmentations into calculations so that, for instance, a user’s bone structure will not read as damaged just because they have plastic implants. It provides constant updates in their personal PAN, making checking your vitals into a Bonus Action.

*Biowaste Storage Expansion								Legal*

Retractable webs for the user’s hands or feet, cyberfins make swimming a breeze.

When active, increase the user’s Physical limit for Swimming Tests by 2 and the Swimming skill by +1.

A user may have one pair on their feet and another on their hands. Lastly, a user with a pair of cyberfins has their Swimming speed increased to 150% of normal or 200% with two pairs.

Note that engaged cyberfins make use of that limb difficult for fine motor work, lowering the user’s Physical limit or a held weapon’s accuracy by 1 for activities such as making repairs, typing, dancing and so on. Activating or deactivating cyberfins is a Use Device Action.

*Dermal Plating*

*Rating 1*								3,000¥		0.5 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*								9,000¥		1.5 Essence	Restricted Licence

Hard plastic and ceramic fibre plates are bonded to the user’s skin. The plates are clearly visible and are even more obvious to the touch but they can be cosmetically stylised for colour and surface texture. Dermal plating gives you bonus Armour equal to its Rating (cumulative with other Armour, without adding Encumbrance). Dermal plating cannot be combined with other augmentations to the skin that provide armour, including orthoskin.

*[Alphaware] Dermatough Plating (Rating 3)*			11,000¥		1.2 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Gastric Neurostimulator					2,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal*

A simple set of electro-stimulators that respond to nausea by correcting the stomach, inner ear or other affected areas with tiny electrical impulses, rendering the user immune to the effects of nausea or motion sickness. Quite popular with sailors, acrobats and those orbital-intended workers. The user is immune to Nausea.

*Grapple Gun							5,000¥		0.5 Essence	Restricted Licence*

This is an implanted version of the grapple gun. It can shoot a grappling hook up to 120 metres (the limit of its extreme range). (Ranges: Short 0-6m / Medium 7-24m / Long 25-60m / 61-120m.) It comes equipped with an internal winch to pull back the grapple (or pull up loads) Use the *Exotic Ranged Weapon – Grappling Hook* skill to shoot it. It doesn’t store any rope inside it, but you can attach an external rope before you shoot the grapple. Micro rope can support a weight of up to 100kg; standard and stealth ropes can support a weight of up to 400 kg. Reinforced rope can support a weight of up to 600kg.

*Internal Air Tank*

*Rating 1*								4,500¥		0.25 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								6,500¥		0.25 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								8,000¥		0.25 Essence	Legal

The internal air tank replaces part of one lung with a pressurised internal air reserve that allows you to hold your breath for up to (Rating) hours. This allows extended underwater operations and complete protection from inhalation-vector toxin attacks as long as you’re holding your breath. Activating or de-activating the tank is a Use Device Action. It can also be set to activate automatically if it detects the need for air. If linked to your PAN, you can always be aware of the tank’s exact air level and purity. Refilling the air tank with pressurised air through an intake valve (located under your ribcage) takes about five minutes per hour of air tank capacity needed, or you can refill it through six hours of normal breathing per hour of air tank capacity.

*Internal Router							15,000¥		0.7 Essence	Legal*

Using the body’s internal neural network as “wires”, the internal router allows the user’s cybernetics to communicate with one another as if they were wirelessly connected and, if expanded via a datajack or similar broadcast-enabled piece of cyberware, with the rest of the user’s gear.

*LED Tattoos											Legal*

*Small*								100¥+		0.05 Ess/1 Cap

*Medium*								500¥+		0.1 Ess/2 Cap

*Large*								1,000¥+		0.2 Ess/4Cap

LED tattoos have staged a surprising comeback. A simple LED display is implanted under the skin, bright enough to be seen through the dermal layer when active, vanishing from sight when inactive. Available in three general sizes – small (placed on a wrist, ankle or behind an ear), medium (covering much of a forearm or upper arm, the small of the back or over the heart) or large (covering most of the back or scalp) – LED tattoos combine the showcasing of one’s interests and expression of personality with the ability to remove or change those that are no longer quite so definitive. The ability to deactivate them further allows for someone to switch between club mode, where they fly their freak flag, and work mode, where they blend in with sedate corporate culture. It should be noted that there is some division between those with “real” tattoos and “light posers” who are unwilling to get proper ink done.

*Muscle Replacement*

*Rating 1	Cheap Charlie Muscles*					25,000¥		1 Essence		Restricted Licence

*Rating 2	Built Brick Muscles*						50,000¥		2 Essence		Restricted Licence

*Rating 3	Arnie Awesome Muscles*					75,000¥		3 Essence		Restricted Licence

Why take the time to exercise when you can just install a physique? Vat-grown synthetic muscles replace or augment your own and calcium treatments and skeletal reinforcement contribute to your overall strength. It increases both your Strength and Agility attributes by its rating. It cannot be combined with other augmentations to the muscles (such as muscle augmentation or muscle toner bioware).

*Nutrition Storage System*

*Rating 1*								500¥		0.1 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								1,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								1,500¥		0.3 Essence	Legal

An onboard reserve of tasteless food paste and water, the former released directly into your stomach, the later into your mouth and throat. Each Rating point allows for a day’s worth of food and water to be stored. The reservoirs are refilled through an external port and part of the user’s Lifestyle cost. This augmentation is not compatible with the elastic stomach genetech.

*Reaction Enhancers*

*Rating 1*								13,000¥		0.3 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*								26,000¥		0.6 Essence	Restricted Licence

By replacing specific, isolated vertebrae of your spinal column with segments of superconducting material, your reactions to events become quicker. Add the Rating of reactions enhancers to your Reaction attribute (and remember to adjust Initiative and Physical limit accordingly). Reaction enhancers are incompatible with other enhancements to Reaction, except Wired Reflexes.

*[Alphaware] Elite Reaction Enhancers	(Rating 2)*		32,000¥		0.48 Essence	Restricted Licence

*For the Elite!*

*Skillwires*

*Rating 1*								2,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								4,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								6,000¥		0.3 Essence	Legal

Skillwires are a system of neuromuscular controllers that overlie the body’s natural nervous system; they are capable of aiding or completely overriding muscular movement, controlled by the “muscle memory” played through a skilljack. This system allows you to use activesofts with a rating up to your skillwire’s rating, but only if that activesoft is running on your implanted skilljack. Skillwires are incompatible with reflex recorder bioware.

*Skin Toner							8,000¥		0.5 Essence	Legal*

Gently weaving ruthenium polymer into the user’s skin and implanting a dedicated control system to watch over it, skin toner allows the user to select any shade of colour for their skin tone. The limited processor requires the entire body to be generally the same colour, minus some minor gradients for tanning, flesh density and so forth. The user may change skin colour with a Use Device Action.

*[Alphaware] Transformative Epidermis*				10,000¥		0.4 Essence	Legal

*This upgraded tech allows even finer control and allows freckle patterns!*

*Smuggling Compartments					7,500¥		0.2 Essence	Legal*

For items that won’t fit in a fingertip but that you still can’t afford to have found, smuggling compartments can be placed in part of the body that can be easily hollowed out/replaced. This includes ribs and the space between them, hip bones, shoulder blades and so forth. These compartments can allow the storage of small and mini-sized items of appropriate size and shape. The compartment has a Concealability of -10. Inserting or retrieving on object requires a Complex Action.

*Wired Reflexes*

*Rating 1*								30,000¥		2 Essence		Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*								140,000¥		3 Essence		Restricted Licence

This highly invasive, painful, life-changing operation adds a multitude of neural boosters and adrenaline stimulators in strategic locations throughout your body work to catapult you into a whole new world where everything around you seem to move in slow motion. Those with wired reflexes tend to be twitchy and even their regular movements may appear unusual. Each rating point of wired reflexes gives you +1 Reaction (and accompanying bonus to Initiative and Physical limit) and +1D6 Initiative Die. Wired reflexes cannot be combined with any other form of Initiative enhancement, except Reaction Enhancers.

*Reflex Trigger*						9,000¥		0.2 Essence

A reflex trigger is an accessory for wired reflexes, allowing the user to cybernetically turn the reflexes on or off as a Use Device Action. The wired reflexes and the reflex trigger must be installed simultaneously, as a package; the trigger cannot be retrofitted later. When turned off, the reflex trigger adds 1 to the threshold for tests to detect the wired reflexes with a cyberware scanner.

*Stepped Reflex Trigger*					11,000¥		0.2 Essence

Rather than completely turning off their wired reflexes, some users prefer to turn them down. This modification to the reflex trigger allows users to operate their wired reflexes at a lower level than the level at which they were purchased.

*Redline your reflexes because you know you can push it to the max. With stepped reflex trigger included!*

#### **Cyberlimbs**
In today’s world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and -torsos are considered cyberlimbs, although they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

Cyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility Ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test, use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and -feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply to tests directly involving those limbs). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity.

Cyberlimbs give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity Cost [in brackets]. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don’t have cyberweapons installed – their unarmed DV is (STR)P.

*Obvious Cyberlimbs:* These implants are immediately recognisable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colours but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellent and disturbing. This can affect your social dealing in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.

*Synthetic Cyberlimbs:* Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The face that they’re cybernetic gives them a -8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone’s looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.

#### **Cyberlimb Upgrades**

*Bulk Modification										Legal*

Most cyberlimbs are designed to be relatively lifelike – extremely so in the case of synthetic limbs, but there are those who wear their chrome loud and proud and, for them, the bulk modification is a gift from above. While only available for obvious cyberlimbs, the bulk modification trades for greater volume and with greater volume comes more upgrade capabilities. While bulk modification is available in six Rating, the limb in question is limited to Rating 1 for a hand/foot/half-skull, Rating 2 for lower arm/lower leg/skull, Rating 3 for full arm/full leg and Rating 6 for the torso.

For each point of Rating, the modified limb gains +1 Capacity.

*Rating 1*								500¥		+[1] Capacity

*Rating 2*								1,000¥		+[2] Capacity

*Rating 3*								1,500¥		+[3] Capacity

*Rating 4*								2,000¥		+[4] Capacity

*Rating 5*								2,500¥		+[5] Capacity

*Rating 6*								3,000¥		+[6] Capacity

*Cyberarm Gyromount						6,000¥		[8] Capacity	Forbidden Legality*

This must be installed in a full or partial cyberarm. When activated, counterweights pop out of your wrist and a small gyro spins up to provide you with better balance and reduced recoil for improving your firing capability. Meanwhile, small children stare at you. It neutralises up to 3 points of recoil and movement modifiers. Activating or deactivating the system is a Use Device Action.

*Cyberfinger Light						50¥		[1] Capacity	Legal*

A simple, small flashlight shining from the tip of your finger. Comes in low-light and infrared varieties and an assortments of colours.

*Cyberfinger Lighter						50¥		[1] Capacity	Legal*

Good for lighting cigarettes… or fuses.

*Cyberholster							2,000¥		[5] Capacity	Restricted Legality*

You can hold a taser or any pistol- or smaller-sized weapon within the holster, completely enclosed until you activate it. A cyberholster can also be used as a smuggling compartment to store items no larger than a pistol.

*Cyberskates (pair)						500¥		[2] Capacity	Legal*

A simple modification where retractable skates are placed in the user’s cyberfeet, these are virtually useless unless taken in pairs. When engaged, the user’s walking and running speeds are improved by fifty percent, but the unsteady balance results in a lowering of their Physical limit by 1 while the skates are in use. Activating or deactivating the skates is a Use Device Action.

*Grapple Hand							2,000¥		[10] Capacity	Restricted Legality*

A modification to a cyberarm (either partial or full) that consists of a winch, a feed system capable of loading up to thirty meters of wire and a pneumatic launcher that can fire the cyberhand up to the full range of wire, which also serves as a command path to let the hand grab hold of a distant target. Once a firm grip is secured, the winch can pull them toward the hand at the rate of ten metres per Combat Turn or half that silently. Should a grip not be made, it can rewind the hand at a rate of twenty-five metres per turn or ten metres silently. It takes one minute for the air compressor to ready the hand for another shot.

Use Exotic Ranged Weapon (Grapple Gun) for targeting with the launched hand.

Grapple Fist	Accuracy 4	7S	AP-2	SS	RC -

*Hydraulic Jacks (pair)*

*Rating 1*								2,500¥		[1] Capacity	Legal

*Rating 2*								5,000¥		[2] Capacity	Legal

*Rating 3*								7,500¥		[3] Capacity	Legal

*Rating 4*								10,000¥		[4] Capacity	Legal

*Rating 5*								12,500¥		[5] Capacity	Legal

*Rating 6*								15,000¥		[6] Capacity	Legal

This implants requires you to have two cyberlegs with a hydraulic jack of identical Ratings in each leg. Each Rating point adds +1 to your Physical limit and dice pool for jumping and sprinting, as well as adding twenty percent to your maximum jump distance and reducing your falling distance by two metres for the purpose of calculating falling damage.

*Skimmers (pair)							4,000¥		[4] Capacity	Legal*

A more complex option for cyberfeet is the use of ground-effect platforms, based on skimmer drone technology, to provide a cushion of air beneath the user and allow them to hover a few centimetres above the ground. It takes some practice to get the hang of it, but once mastered, the skimmers allow the user to move at double their normal walking or running speed when engaged. The fragile balance required to manoeuvre them reduces the user’s Physical limit by 2 for such actions. Note that these are completely useless unless taken in pairs and they’re unusable if the user attempts to carry any significant extra weight. Activating or deactivating the skates is a Use Device Action.
#### **Cyber Implant Weapons**
Cyber-implant weapons can be installed into cyberlimbs or directly into the meat. They’re popular with the denizens of urban wastelands like the Barrens and with street samurai who never want to go anywhere unarmed.

*Cyberguns											Restricted Legality*

Generally speaking, these are mounted in a cyberarm, but you could install one in a leg or even your torso. Cyberguns are distinct from cyberholsters in that the gun itself can be controlled and fired directly, as an extension of your body. Depending on the size of the gun, cyberguns take up part of your forearm or replace your arm altogether, with the functional parts of the arm built around the gun. Smaller cyberguns fire through a hidden port in the palm or knuckles, while larger cyberguns fold back the user’s hand at the wrist. All cyberguns come pre-equipped with smartgun systems. All cyberguns have internal magazines (m) and can be equipped with a hidden external ammo port. However, once you attack a clip to the side of your forearm or the back of your elbow, the cybergun becomes kind of obvious.

*Foot Blade (Retractable)	DV (STR+2)P	AP -2		2,500¥		0.2 Ess/2 Cap	Forbidden Legality*

This modification implants a retractable blade into the foot which can be used to deliver devastating kick attacks. Most commonly, the blade comes from the front of the foot or the heel.

*Hand Blade (Retractable)	DV (STR+2)P	AP -2		2,500¥		0.2 Ess/2 Cap	Forbidden Legality*

Hand blades slip out the side of the hand, opposite the thumb, parallel to the hand, and while they are universally thin and sharp, they come in a variety of shapes and styles.

*Hand Razors (Retractable)	DV (STR+1)P	AP -3		1,250¥		0.2 Ess/2 Cap	Forbidden Legality*

Hand razors are blades two to three centimetres long, made of chromed steel or carbon fibre. They either slide out from beneath your fingernails or replace them entirely.

*Shock Hand		DV 9S(e)	AP -5		5,000¥		0.25 Ess/4 Cap	Restricted Legality*

The shock hand is like a shock glove built into the palm of your hand, perfect for inflicting a nasty shock to anything it comes into contact with. Shock hands deal electricity damage and have ten charges in each hard; when plugged in they recharge at a rate of one charge per ten seconds.

*Spurs (Retractable)		DV (STR+3)P	AP-2		5,000¥		0.3 Ess/3 Cap	Forbidden Legality*

Spurs are one to four blades or spikes protruding from the back of your wrist or your knuckles, sticking out from your fist as much as thirty centimetres.  
### **Bioware**
Bioware is subtler, more holistic and less invasive than cyberware, at the cost of being substantially pricer. Instead of replacing body parts with machines, bioware augments the body’s own functions and integrates transplanted organs that function as natural features. The application of biotechnology is a tricky business, as the fine balance of homeostasis between the body’s organic systems must be maintained. In the last decade, bionics and bio-engineering techniques have taken bioware from cutting edge to commonplace. Bioware is more expensive monetarily, costs less Essence and is much harder to spot. Also – and we’d like to think this goes without saying – bioware has no wireless capability at all.
#### **Basic Bioware**
*Bilateral Coordination Co-Processor				4,500¥		0.2 Essence	Legal*

The BCC is a small amount of specialised brain tissue added to the corpus collosum, which balances dexterity between the left and right portions of the body. This augmentation negates 2 points of penalties for using your off hand.

*[Alphaware] BBCA*						5,400¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Biosculpted Ear Points						250¥		0.05 Essence	Legal*

Purely cosmetic, ear points can be removed and smoothed down or added and raised to points.

*Bone Density Augmentation*

*Rating 1*				Damage (STR) P			5,000¥		0.3 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*				Damage (STR +1) P		10,000¥		0.6 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*				Damage (STR +2) P		15,000¥		0.9 Essence	Legal

The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase the density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened and the increased bone density increases your weight a bit. Your Body attribute is increased by the bone density Rating for the purpose of Damage Resistance Tests. You also deal Physical damage in unarmed combat, based on the Rating of the augmentation. Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to the bones, including bone lacing cyberware.

*[Alphaware] Bone Density Augmentation (Rating 3)*		18,000¥		0.72 Essence	Legal

*Cat’s Eyes							4,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vision, providing low-light vision. Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyberware eye enhancements or replacements.

*[Alphaware] Tiger’s Eyes*					4,800¥		0.08 Essence	Legal

*Dietware							1,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

Dietware consists of one of several modifications to the stomach and digestive tract that inhibits the digestion and absorption of food, especially carbohydrates and fat. This keeps the user slender against all but the most gluttonous of appetites.

*\*A quick reminder that food ingested but not processed has to go **somewhere**. Half star, don’t recommend.*

*Enhanced Articulation						24,000¥		0.3 Essence	Legal*

A number of procedures like joint-surface coating, re-lubrication and tendon and ligament augmentation lead to more fluid muscle and joint action. Enhanced articulation provides you with a +1 dice pool bonus to Acrobatics Tests and a +1 increase to your Physical limit (cumulative with other limit modifiers).

*[Alphaware] Expert Articulation*				28,800¥		0.24 Essence	Legal

*Expanded Volume										Legal*

*Rating 1*								2,000¥		0.1 Essence

*Rating 2*								4,000¥		0.2 Essence

*Rating 3*								6,000¥		0.3 Essence

The amount of air exchanged in each breath a metahuman takes is about half a litre; this is known as the tidal volume. By expanding the tidal volume of each breath, the lungs, which hold five times that much air, become more efficient in oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange and improve the user’s overall endurance. The user may add this bioware’s Rating to dice pools for all Fatigue Tests.

*[Alphaware] Expanded Volume (Rating 3)*			7,200¥		0.24 Essence	Legal

*Gills								24,000¥		0.3 Essence	Legal*

Set into the sides of the user’s neck, gills ensure the user no longer has to worry about drowning. A user with gills can breathe water (either fresh or salt, chosen when first installed).

*[Alphaware] Gills*						28,800¥		0.24 Essence	Legal

*Hand and Foot Webbing					1,000¥		0.05 Essence	Legal*

A simple implantation, usually added in pairs, adding webbing between the user’s toes or fingers, which are expanded by simple muscle contraction and withdrawn the same way (each is a Bonus Action), allowing the user improved speed while swimming.

For each hand or foot that has webbing engaged, the user gains +1 to their Physical limit for Swimming tests, while each matched pair adds +1 to the swimmer’s speed multiplier. When webbing is engaged on a user’s hands, they suffer a -1 penalty to their Physical limit for any actions that include fine manipulation.

*Rating 2*								62,000¥		0.4 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*								93,000¥		0.6 Essence	Restricted Licence

This biological weaving treatment enhances existing muscle tissue, rather than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are woven into existing muscle fibres, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your Strength. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Strength, including the muscle replacement cyberware.

*Rating 2*								64,000¥		0.4 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*								99,000¥		0.6 Essence	Restricted Licence

This treatment increases muscle fibre elasticity in existing muscle tension, resulting in increased muscle tension and flexibility while providing a smooth and ropy physique. Muscle toner adds its rating to your Agility. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Agility, including the muscle replacements cyberware.

*[Alphaware] Muscle Toner (Rating 3)*				118,800¥		0.48 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Nictitating Membrane						1,000¥		0.05 Essence	Legal*

A simple transparent “third eyelid” that keeps the eye moist and protects it from damage by assorted irritants, the nictitating membrane is similar to that possessed by several animals, most notably reptiles and sharks. Unlike normal eyelids, the nictitating membrane slides horizontally and is somewhat unsettling to see as most mammals, including metahumans, don’t possess such a feature. It’s useful in diving, to keep floating detritus from damaging the eye itself but also on land for brushing away smoke or grit. A tinted version is available to act as a defence against bright light, but this version cannot be seen through clearly, resulting in an either-or proposition that few use. Note that nictitating membranes are not compatible with cybereyes.

Standard nictitating membranes add a +2 dice pool modifier to resist eye irritants, such as CS gas or pepper spray, as well as ordinary smoke, plus allow the user to keep their eyes open underwater without discomfort.

Tinted versions give similar benefits and further act as flare compensation when engaged but provide a -1 dice pool penalty to Perception Tests using vision.

*[Alphaware] Nictitating Membrane*				1,200¥		0.04 Essence	Legal

*Orthoskin*

*Rating 1*								6,000¥		0.25 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*								12,000¥		0.5 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3*								18,000¥		0.75 Essence	Restricted Licence

A web of biofibres in the skin provides the equivalent of personal armour while being virtually indistinguishable from natural skin. Orthoskin adds its Rating to your Armour Rating and is cumulative with other Armour. Orthoskin cannot be combined with skin augmentations that give you Armour, including dermal plating.

*[Alphaware] Orthoskin (Rating 3)*				22,000¥		0.6 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Orthoskin, Dragon Hide*

*Rating 1	[Alphaware]*						9,500¥		0.28 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3	[Alphaware]*						24,000¥		0.68 Essence	Restricted Licence

While many expect this mod to involve scales, that would be a simple cosmetic modification unconnected to the actual upgrade. Dragon Hide weaves flame-retardant materials into the orthoskin, which distributes thermal impact, prevents blistering and reduces overall burning as energy dissipates across the larger surface.

In addition to the standard benefits of orthoskin, the user gains +2 Body for resisting fire damage, but also has a -2 dice pool penalty on Perception Tests involving ambient or tactile heat detection.

*Orthoskin, Penguin Blubber*

*Rating 1	[Alphaware]*						9,500¥		0.28 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3	[Alphaware]*						24,000¥		0.68 Essence	Restricted Licence

Thicker than normal orthoskin, penguin blubber produces a protective oil that prevents the skin from drying and cracking in sub-freezing temperatures while protecting internal organs against the cold. It also gives the user a somewhat tubby look. Users with penguin blubber can happily frolic barefoot on snow or take a dip in freezing water, enjoying temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius without long-term effect. Adding insulating material over this can result in a toasty-warm explorer in even the harshest Antarctic temperatures.

In addition to the standard benefits of orthoskin, the user gains +2 Body for resisting cold damage and can quintuple the time exposed to harsh cold environs for purposes of Fatigue damage.

*Orthoskin, Sealskin*

*Rating 1	[Alphaware]*						9,500¥		0.28 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 3	[Alphaware]*						24,000¥		0.68 Essence	Restricted Licence

This skin is coated with naturally refreshing water-repelling oils that allow the user to cut through the waves with ease. The user’s skin retains a somewhat moist appearance at all times.

In addition to the standard benefits of orthoskin, remove all penalties associated with moving through water, allowing the user to operate underwater as easily as in air. Note that this does not include either water breathing functionality or swimming ability (those are sold separately).

*Platelet Factories						17,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal*

Platelet factories increase your body’s ability to handle Physical damage by accelerating the production of platelets within bone marrow and their concentration in the blood, which helps stop bleeding faster. Any time you would take 2 or more boxes of damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, reduce the damage by one box.

*[Alphaware] Platelet Complex*				20,000¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Quills								2,500¥		0.25 Essence	Legal*

A quick transplant and a hormonal and retroviral cocktail are all that are needed to replace select follicles with tough, needle-like spines similar to a hedgehog’s. Each transplant procedure covers the surface area of a limb (e.g. an arm, a leg, the torso, the head). Individual quills are hollow and have a length of 2-4 centimetres. The quills can be wielding in melee combat using the Exotic Melee Weapon (Quills) skill. (STR+1)P, Reach -, AP+1.

*Synthacardium*

*Rating 1*								30,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								60,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								90,000¥		0.3 Essence	Legal

Artificially enhanced myocardium allows cardiovascular functions to be performed more efficiently, enabling the heart to keep the blood better oxygenated. The synthacardium adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus to your tests using skills in the Athletics skill group.

*[Alphaware] Synthcardium (Rating 3)*				110,000¥		0.24 Essence	Legal

*Tail								2,000¥		0.25 Essence	Legal*

The standard bioware tail is grafted directly to the user’s spinal column, allowing for natural-feeling use. Natural tails tend to react to subconscious thoughts, giving away the user’s emotional state, otherwise idly swaying a bit when the individual it not paying attention. Ordinary tails are available in lengths of up to one metre, with textured fur or scales being a common modification and quietly serve as extra balance.

*Toxin Extractor Liver*

*Rating 1*								5,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								10,000¥		0.4 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								15,000¥		0.6 Essence	Legal

*Rating 4*								20,000¥		0.8 Essence	Legal

A specially cultivated cluster of cells in your liver improves its filtering capabilities. The toxin extractor adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus to all your Toxin Resistance Tests. 

*[Alphaware] Toxin Extractor Liver (Rating 4)*			24,000¥		0.64 Essence	Legal

*Tracheal Filter*

*Rating 1*								4,500¥		0.1 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								13,500¥		0.3 Essence	Legal

*Rating 4*								18,000¥		0.4 Essence	Legal

Implanted at the top of your trachea, this organ can absorb airborne impurities and keep them from reaching your lungs. The filter adds its Rating as a dice pool bonus to Toxin Resistance Tests against inhalation vector toxins. 

*[Alphaware] Tracheal Filter (Rating 4)*				22,000¥		0.32 Essence	Legal

*Tusks, Medium							500¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

All the rage during the big Orksploitation craze, tusks continue to be sought by ork posers worldwide and, quietly, are purchased by orks who have lost their own tusks due to mistreatment or combat. Note that replacing a broken tusk costs an ork no Essence.
#### **Cultured Bioware**
Cultured bioware must be tailor-made for the body in which it will eventually find a home. This means it is more expensive and takes longer to acquire than the off-the-shelf-kind.

*Cerebellum Booster*

*Rating 1*								50,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

This one’s a sort of Holy Grail for neuro-amplification. While the cerebral booster’s been established for twenty years, increasing the user’s instinctive nature has eluded researchers. It was a breakthrough in Aztechnology’s research that finally found the key; rather than a focus on the hindbrain, the right target was in the cerebellum. With careful amplification of the lateral cerebellum, the inception of movement and absorption of sensory data can be sped up, resulting in a more intuitive response to external stimuli and an improved joining of thought to action in an expressive sense. That is to say, it makes the user more instinctive and able to respond to stimuli without those pesky higher-functions needing to be involved.

The cerebellum booster increases the user’s Intuition attribute by its Rating.

*[Alphaware] Cerebellum Booster (Rating 1)*			60,000¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Cerebral Booster*

*Rating 1*								31,500¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								63,000¥		0.4 Essence	Legal

The convolutions and gyri of your cerebrum are augmented and amplified with additional nervous tissue, improving overall brain function. Your cerebral booster increases your Logic attribute by its Rating.

*[Alphaware] Cerebral Booster (Rating 1)*			37,500¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*[Alphaware] Cerebral Booster (Rating 2)*			75,000¥		0.32 Essence	Legal

*Clean Metabolism						1,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal*

With a series of alterations to the recipient’s exocrine glands, liver and pancreas – and the addition of tailored bacteria to the intestines – this bioware more efficiently digests food and drink. The main effect, however, is that most of the more embarrassing and unpleasant effects of the digestive system are eliminated. Users rarely develop body odour, belch or pass wind. Even the person’s sweat and bodily waste are sanitised. This treatment is popular among high-society players and trendy types who wish to avoid a social faux pas.

*[Alphaware] Sanitised Metabolism*				1,200¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Damage Compensator*

*Rating 1*								2,000¥		0.1 Essence	Forbidden Legality

*Rating 2*								4,000¥		0.2 Essence	Forbidden Legality

*Rating 3*								6,000¥		0.3 Essence	Forbidden Legality

*Rating 4*								8,000¥		0.4 Essence	Forbidden Legality

Damage compensators are essentially cut-offs stored in the nervous pathways that report pain from the body back to your brain. You ignore a number of damage boxes (your choice of Physical, Stun or a combination of the two) equal to the compensator’s Rating before determining your injury modifiers.

*[Alphaware] Damage Compensator (Rating 4)*			10,000¥		0.32 Essence	Forbidden Legality

*Mnemonic Enhancer*

*Rating 1*								9,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								18,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

This highly concentrated growth of grey matter gets attached to the brain’s memory centres, improving both short- and long-term memory. Add the enhancer’s Rating as a dice pool bonus to your Knowledge, Language and memory-related tests as well as your Mental Limit.

*[Alphaware] Mnemonic Enhancer (Rating 1)*			11,000¥		0.08 Essence	Legal

*[Alphaware] Mnemonic Enhancer (Rating 2)*			22,000¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Reception Enhancer						10,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal*

Reception enhancers were a happy accident, a result of twenty years of looking for what would eventually become the cerebellum booster. The reaction enhancer is an improvement in the data-processing and observation sections of the brain, allowing the user to handle multiple sources of data without being overwhelmed, a key development in dealing with the modern world’s non-stop assault via advertising. But cutting away all the distractions, the user can focus on what’s important. Like the ads. The user ignores distractions and interfering sight/sound/odour modifiers for Perception Tests.

*[Alphaware] Reception Enhancer*				12,000¥		0.16 Essence	Legal

*Sleep Regulator							12,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal*

The sleep regulator is a modification to the hypothalamus, allowing for longer periods of wakefulness, an incredibly useful advantage for anyone with any profession, not just shadowrunners. You need less sleep per day and the sleep you get is deep and restful (and harder to wake you up from). The sleep regulator lets you get by with three hours of sleep each night and stay awake for twice as long as normal before having to resist sleep deprivation fatigue. Resting hours for healing purposes are not affected.

*[Alphaware] Sleep Regulator*					15,000¥		0.08 Essence	Legal

*Synaptic Booster*

*Rating 1*								95,000¥		0.5 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Rating 2*								190,000¥		1 Essence		Restricted Licence

The nerve cells making up the spinal cord are both broadened and replicated with this bioware, allowing for more neural bandwidth. The result is a much faster reaction time. The booster confers a bonus of +1 Reaction (and accompanying bonus to Initiative and Physical limit) and +1D6 Initiative Die per point of Rating. The synaptic booster cannot be combined with other forms of Reaction enhancement.

*[Alphaware] Synaptic Booster (Rating 1)*			114,000¥		0.4 Essence	Restricted Licence

*[Alphaware] Synaptic Booster (Rating 2)*			228,000¥		0.8 Essence	Restricted Licence

*Trauma Damper*

*Rating 1*								4,000¥		0.1 Essence	Legal

*Rating 2*								8,000¥		0.2 Essence	Legal

*Rating 3*								12,000¥		0.3 Essence	Legal

Somewhat misnamed as it doesn’t actually reduce physical damage so much as make the user blissfully resistant to pain, the trauma damper is a series of pain receptors added to the base of the thalamus with one job: crank out endorphins in response to negative stimuli, such as pain or fatigue. In effect, the user experiences a “runner’s high” that counteracts some of the pain while leaving the mind somewhat foggy. There’s a small bio-hack that can keep the user in a constant low level of pain, forcing the body to keep producing endorphins 24/7. Not recommended, but ‘dorphs can be found in many communities.

The trauma damper reduces the user’s Damage Modifier by up to its Rating, but when doing so it reduces the user’s limits and Reaction by a matching amount.

This bike is a classic, heavy-bodied, heavily chromed road hog, armoured and styled for intimidation. Very popular with a certain type of go-ganger and with big, tough orks and trolls who don’t worry about little things like “embodying a cliché”. This bike is even tough enough to be used in the combat biking circuit.

*Standard Upgrades:* Metahuman adjustment (troll)

|4/3|3|2|8|4|1|2|2|

This cheap, ubiquitous electric subcompact was made in North America for decades. Even after North American production ceased, dozens of generic rip-offs were contract produced throughout the third world. The sheer amount of Chrysler-Nissan Jackrabbits on the road means the older model must continue to be supported.

*Ford Americar							16,000¥	Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/3|3|2|11|6|1|2|4|

This four-door sedan has an affordable price point, capacious luggage storage and safety features that, combined, made it the bestselling family car in North America for decades before losing out to the Mercury Comet. The Americar is reliable and economical, but not fast or sexy. If you need to ferry four metahumans from point a to point B, a Ford Americar is probably the most straightforward and anonymous way to do so. It’s not flashy and it’s not stylish but sometimes flashy gets you killed.

*Mercury Comet							20,000¥	Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Seats**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/4|3|2|11|6|2|2|4|

The 2073 model marks the return of the Comet, a sedan for every occasion. Ford/Ares is marketing this as the average car with unlimited potential. This isn’t like the Chameleon or the Sin-Hyang with aftermarket tuning – the Comet has been designed with interchangeable body panels to make this a car for everyone. Styles and colours galore fit any taste. Every exterior panel on the Comet can be easily switched out and changing all the panels takes only about a half hour. Versatility around a rather robust crash cage has put this new offering in plenty of garages.

*Hyundai Shin-Hyung							28,500¥	Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|5/4|6|3|10|6|1|2|4|

This cheap four-door sports sedan is a fast, powerful car for corp youth to show off their moxie to their friends in a socially acceptable and constructive way. Available for low prices out of the box, the Shin-Hyung is often heavily customised by tuners and street racing enthusiasts to the point of being far more functional and barely recognisable. The Shin-Hyung can be bought cheap, goes fast and handles well. What else could you want? These facts have made it popular with Triad and Yakuza elements as well as more affluent street gangs and slumming rich kids.

*Standard Upgrades:* Four extra Body Modification Slots

|6/4|7|3|10|8|3|5|2|

This sleek, classic, low-slung speed machine mixes business and pleasure into perfection. Situated perfectly at the intersection of luxury and performance, this is a turbo-charged sportscar that is only a pipe dream for most slags working their way up through the shadows. Its sexy lines and powerful engine make it consistently powerful among muscle car enthusiasts.

*Standard Upgrades:* Anti-Theft System (Rating 2), Passenger Protections System (Rating 6)

*SK-Bentley Concordat						65,000¥	Legal*

| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|5/4|5|2|12|12|2|4|4|

This luxury sedan is stylish, stately and impressive. It is fast and powerful, comfortable and safe, opulently appointed and, most importantly, a status symbol. The SK-Bentley Concordat is the kind of car that simstars and orxploitation rappers drive; a runner behind the wheel of one has made the big time indeed. Either that or they stole it.

*Mitsubishi Nightsky							320,000¥	Legal*

Decadent, secure and high-tech, this armoured limousine isn’t for you. It’s for corp executives, media stars and Mr Johnson; only in their company will you enjoy its spacious interior and luxurious amenities.

*Standard Upgrades:* Amenities (Luxury), Life Support (Level 1)

|5/5|4|2|14|10|1|2|3|

This is a classic pickup with great off-road suspension, superior handling and a loyal customer base. This low-maintenance design is a bit dated but sees widespread use in third world nations and rural areas, especially the NAN. It’s not the most wiz thing you could drive, although its powerful engine and storage space could certainly come in handy if you have some heavy duty hauling to do.

*Standard Upgrades:* Off-Road Suspension, Special Equipment (Open Box Storage)

|3/3|3|1|16|12|1|2|6|

This long-running top seller from GM is a capacious (and armoured!) delivery van favoured by everybody from legitimate shipping and logistics companies to security agencies to heavy mob crews to shadowrunners. It has lots of room for people, gear or whatever you need to move, plus an engine and chassis that can take a ton of punishment and keep on running.

*Standard Upgrades:* Four extra Body Modification Slots

A rigger’s got to eat, right? One way to have food where you need it is to make it look like you’re there to serve food while you’re actually spying on local corporate traffic. This mobile food-service truck, usually referred to as a food truck or, much less politely, a roach coach, provides facilities for a variety of food-related activities. Trucks come in three varieties: prepared food, unprepared food and frozen treats. Prepared food trucks offer things like ice cream, chips, sodas and prepackaged sandwiches. Inside, they’re set up with a large storage unit that can be specialised as a freezer and/or refrigerator, along with some heating element for food served warm. Unprepared food trucks offer a limited menu of items usually centred around a certain theme. Inside, they have a slightly smaller cold storage area and heating element, along with a sink, sanitation facility and prep area. Frozen treat trucks serve the standard frozen pops of every kind, with specialised ones offering scooped ice cream. The back is nothing but freezer space.

The Ares Chuck Wagon is the premier roach coach because it has windows on both sides to increase service speed. Since seating isn’t a high priority, the front area includes the driver’s seat and one fold-down jump seat. The Chuck Wagon is not a race truck by any means but at least the ride is smooth and the food is plentiful. If you stock it, of course.

*Ares Roadmaster							52,000¥	Legal*

This is a fragging armoured car, chummer, and you should be grateful you can buy it legally. Legitimately used to move goods over lands that need secure transportation, the Roadmaster may have the speed and handling of the tank that it is and it may be anything but subtle but it can reliably shrug off small arms fire and even grenades. For many teams, that’s a worthwhile tradeoff.
### **Vehicle Modifications**
Runners who use their vehicles day in and day out to pull their jobs rarely want to keep them as they are off the shelf. In the highly competitive world of shadowrunning, runners need to get every edge they can to avoid winding up dead. Unless otherwise stated, a modification may only be taken once for a vehicle. When a vehicle stat such as Speed or Acceleration is listed as part of a modification attribute (like cost), use the vehicle’s base or *unmodified* value in the calculation. In the case of Handling, which has two values, always use the *higher* value in any calculations.

Every vehicle has a certain number of *Modification Slots* that determine how much extra stuff can be packed into the vehicle. Each vehicle modification has a number of Modification Slots equal to its Body in ***each Modification Category***. There are six Modification Categories: Body, Electromagnetic, Power Train, Protection, Weapons and Cosmetic.

So, a GMC Bulldog with a Body of 16 has 16 Modification Slots in each of the six categories. Modifications only take up the slots for their category. A vehicle cannot exceed its Modification Slots in any category. Not even a little.
### **Vehicle Equipment**
The following are not considered modifications to the vehicle since they do not integrate into the systems of the vehicle in a significant way. They are standard pieces of equipment that can be purchased and easily installed or used.

*Morphing Licence Plate								1,000¥	Forbidden Legality*

While most modern governments primarily use electronic identification for vehicles, they still require some sort of physical identification plate to uniquely identify a vehicle. Since being positively identified is something that an average shadowrunner wants to avoid, most install a special morphing licence plate. Made from smart materials, a morphing licence plate can reshape itself with a Complex Action and mimic any of the forms used in governments around the world today.

*Spoof Chip									500¥	Forbidden Legality*

Governments in the civilised world require that a vehicle be uniquely tagged and broadcast that identification on demand. This allows law enforcement and any authorised government agency (and some unauthorised) to quickly identify and track a vehicle. All of that may sound great to the common wageslave but those are all things that a shadowrunner wants to avoid like a VITAS plague. Consequently, installing a spoof chip has become a common practice for anyone wanted to use a vehicle for their shadow activities. The spoof chip mimics a standard vehicle identifier chip but can be commanded with a Complex Action to change its identifier to a different random value that is arithmetically generated to appear authentic. Installing a spoof chip requires a Hardware + Logic [Logic] (2) Test.

*Tyres, Off-Road									400¥/tyre	Legal*

Designed specifically for rough terrain, these tyres are not as effective as standard tyres on standard roads. When equipped, the vehicle’s off-road Handling is increased by +1 and on-road Handling is reduced by -1. Off-road tyres are also considered to be run flat tyres (see below).

*Tyres, Racing									250¥/tyre	Legal*

The flip-side of off-road tyres, racing tyres are designed to maximise vehicle performance in urban conditions. When equipped, the vehicle’s on-road Handling is increased by +1 and off-road Handling is reduced by -1.

*Tyres, Run Flat									250¥/tyre	Legal*

A common upgrade for shadowrunners, run flat tires are filled with a dense but flexible foam instead of air. They continue to operate even when the tire has been punctured but will quickly deteriorate if the tire suffers significant structure damage.
#### **Body**
Body modifications modify the hull or structure of the vehicle in some form.

*Chameleon Coating		2 Mod Slots				Body x	1,000¥	Forbidden Legality*

Not just for the flighty owner who can’t settle on a paint colour for their vehicle, chameleon coating is an essential tool for keeping a vehicle used for shadow activities inconspicuous. A vehicle with the coating has its exterior hull covered in a specialised kind of polymer that allows it to display any kind of image sent to the system with an electronic signal. This can be as simple as changing the colour of the vehicle or as complex as covering it in moving advertisements and video. Changing the output of the coasting is a Bonus Action. Particularly clever riggers have linked the video feed from their external sensors into the system so that the exterior of the vehicle mimics the environment around it, resulting in a crude (but effective) “cloaking” or blending system. When running in this mode, as long as it is not moving faster than its Walking rate, Perception Tests made to find the vehicle suffer a -3 dice pool penalty.

*Ejection Seats			1 Mod Slot each					750¥	Restricted Licence*

Remember that time when there was an annoying passenger in the back and you wished you could just push a button and fire them out of the vehicle? Well, with ejection seats you can! Using a simple expanding has propulsion system, activated remotely with a Use Device Action, any seat in the vehicle can become a means to eject the occupant of that seat. Seats can be equipped with parachutes if the system is being used for safe egress of someone that you want to be whole when they land or without if not. Traditionally, ejection seats launch vertically upward but they can be configured to launch horizontally or even straight down (particularly vicious in aircraft or watercraft).

*Increased Seating		2 Mod Slots					2,000¥	Legal*

While no riggers like to be the “team mom” or the “runner taxi”, there are plenty of times that they will need to carry more people than their vehicle originally allowed, especially if they’re driving some super-slick European sports car that could only carry two to begin with. With increased seating, a vehicle can comfortably carry more passengers than its original design. This is far more than just jamming in a couple of extra people in – the modification includes all features for carrying people including comfortable (enough) seating, incorporating the vehicle’s safety systems (including PPS if installed) and other personal comfort features such as ventilation and lighting. This can mean rearranging the internal layout of the vehicle, extending it slightly or even adding “external” seating, such as a sidecar on a motorcycle. When this modification is taken, the passenger capacity of the vehicle is increased up to a fifty percent increase of its base value, though the gamesmaster has final say on exactly how many passengers the vehicle can reasonably carry.

*Smuggling Compartment	3 Mod Slots					1,500¥	Forbidden Legality*

You don’t need to run very long before you encounter a situation where you need to keep something (or someone) hidden from authorities that are trying to find it. In these situations, the smuggling compartment is what you need. This modification adds a storage compartment to the vehicle, one that is designed to not easily be found. In general, a smuggling compartment cannot be seen unless a person is specifically looking for hidden compartments or doing a thorough search of the vehicle and even in that case the Perception Test to notice the compartment is made with a -6 penalty. Smuggling compartments are hidden by purely visual means, so fi the contents of the compartment make it detectable by other means – chemical, radioactive, thermographic – these do not suffer a penalty. The gamesmaster determines if an object can fit in a smuggling compartment, based on the size of the vehicle. In general, smuggling compartments are about ten to twenty percent of the overall size of the vehicle itself.

*Shielding		0 Mod Slots							3,000¥	Forbidden Legality*

Compartments can have shielding installed on them to make the compartment difficult to detect by a particular non-visual sense. If this is done, then the -6 penalty applies to that sense as well. Shielding on a smuggling compartment may be taken multiple times, each time specifying a different sensory type (auditory, chemical, radioactive, astral, etc.).

*Winch											Legal*

For those times when a runner needs to pull or tow something and they don’t want to call an underpaid and overweight member of the auto club, there is the winch modification. A winch can be mounted on the front or rear of the vehicle and comes with about one hundred metres of cable and can support a load of up to ten tons, provided the vehicle itself it heavy enough to support this. If wirelessly enabled, the winch hook can be released remotely with a Use Device Action.

*Basic*		1 Mod Slot**					500¥	Legal

The basic winch hasn’t changed its design much in about a hundred years. It has a heavy gauge steel cable ending with a hook or latch and wraps around a powered drum.

*Enhanced*		2 Mod Slots**					4,000¥	Legal

An enhanced winch is generally found in heavy industrial or rescue vehicles but can be useful to a runner. Its winch replaces the hook with an advanced system using a combination of gecko-grip technology and magnetism that can attach to any surface on its target without the need to manually place a hook on an appropriate part. The system can be activated or deactivated with a wireless command (if enabled). The enhanced system can support a load of up to one hundred tons and includes additional stabilisers deployed from the vehicle and onto/into the ground to double the towing vehicle’s weight for lifting purposes.
#### **Electromagnetic**
Electromagnetic modifications are connected to or modify a vehicle’s electronic systems.

*Electromagnetic Shielding	2 Mod Slots				Body x	500¥	Restricted Licence*

When a rigger wants absolute control over the signals that come in and out of their vehicle, there isn’t a better option than the electromagnetic shielding modification. This system builds a system of conductive metal bands into the exterior body of the vehicle, designed to conduct away and dissipate all wireless signals that attempt to penetrate the body of the vehicle, going in or out. This modification only works on vehicles that create an enclosed space – it is useless for vehicles that are open, such as a motorcycle. In game terms, the body of the vehicle acts as a Faraday cage for Noise purposes meaning that no communication is possible through the barrier. When the system is installed, the owner can choose to have certain systems or features be able to move through the barrier by running a physical wire through the cage. Any device that can connect to the body of the vehicle with a wired connection can bypass the Faraday cage.

*Satellite Link			 Mod Slot					500¥	Legal*

Want to have a drone keep tabs on your doss while you sit on a beach halfway across the world? You need a satellite link. Any vehicle equipped with this modification can uplink to communication satellites in low-Earth orbit, connecting to the Matrix from places where no local wireless networks exist. This link limits Noise due to distance to -5. Includes satellite dish.

*SunCell				2 Mod Slots				Body x	500¥	Legal*

For runners that are economically or environmentally minded, the SunCell modification provides a great option. Using powerful solar-energy collectors and a battery system, a vehicle can be powered by collecting solar energy. If operating exclusively during sunny daylight hours, a vehicle has unlimited operational time and needs no other fuel source. In any other conditions (where sunlight isn’t readily available), the vehicle will use up all power stored in the battery and then switch to its standard means of power production (likely a fossil-fuel engine). If operating in a mix of conditions, the SunCell system roughly doubles the operational time of the vehicle between refueling stops.
#### **Power Train**
Power train modifications all deal with how a vehicle is controlled and how the vehicle moves.

*Acceleration Enhancement								Legal*

*Rating 1*				4 Mod Slots*				Accel x*	10,000¥	Legal

*Rating 2*				8 Mod Slots*				Accel x*	25,000¥	Legal

Using a variety of techniques, like adding fuel accelerants (such as nitrous oxide), turbochargers, optimised intakes, afterburners or hydrofoil drives, the acceleration of a vehicle is increased. Due to inherent limitations in a vehicle’s design, its acceleration performance can only be increased so far. In the end, though, there’s nothing like going from zero to gone before you get shot. The Rating of the modification is added to the vehicle’s Acceleration value.

*Handling Enhancement									Legal*

*Rating 1*				4 Mod Slots*				Handl x*	2,000¥	Legal

*Rating 2*				10 Mod Slots*				Handl x*	5,000¥	Legal

*Rating 3*				18 Mod Slots*				Handl x*	12,000¥	Legal

By adjusting the suspension and/or adjusting the workings of control systems, a vehicle can be made more responsive to manual or electronic controls. This can range from optimising control system response times to more dramatic changes like gyroscopic stabilisers or destabilising the structural integrity of the hull. Handling Enhancement can be taken with a Rating of 1 to 3, with the Rating added to the Handling (both on-road and off-road) of the vehicle.

*Improved Economy		2 Mod Slots					7,500¥	Legal*

With this modification, the fuel consumption of the vehicle has been optimised to use the minimum amount necessary for standard operation. Additionally, the vehicle is fitted with a variety of different means to gather operational power from the environment around it including sunlight, static electricity and wind. A vehicle with improved economy doubles its operational time as long as it is operating within normal parameters – no high speed chases.

*Multifuel Engine		4 Mod Slots				Body x	1,000¥	Legal*

For teams that frequently find themselves needing to travel far away from the comforts of modern civilisation, modifying a vehicle with a multifuel engine has proved invaluable. First, a portable plasma furnace is installed on the vehicle that can render small quantities of matter down to its constituent parts. Then, the vehicle’s engine is modified to be able to consume the raw material output of the plasma torch. This allows nearly any matter to be fed into the vehicle as fuel. A vehicle with a multifuel engine can always be refuelled as long as there is raw material around to be processed.

*Rigger Cocoon			4 Mod Slots				Body x	1,000¥	Legal*

For riggers, there is no safer place where they would leave their body than a rigger cocoon. Generally built into the driver’s seat of a vehicle, the cocoon is designed solely for the safety and comfort of someone who’s consciousness is going to be somewhere other than their body. The cocoon has ballistic cloth and hard armoured plating for physical protection, is fire resistant, has its own oxygen supply and carries a host of bio-med sensors to monitor the occupant’s condition. Additionally, the cocoon has a variety of safety systems to keep the occupant safe through the most extreme vehicle manoeuvres and even crashes. Getting into a rigger cocoon takes about a minute but it can be exited with a Complex Action using a quick-release system.

Treat the rigger cocoon as a barrier with an Armour of 12 and Structure of 8. The occupant of the rigger cocoon receives a +6 dice pool bonus to resist damage from crashes or other vehicle manoeuvres.

*Speed Enhancement									Legal*

*Rating 1*				5 Mod Slots*				Speed x*	2,000¥	Legal

*Rating 2*				14 Mod Slots*				Speed x*	5,000¥	Legal

*Rating 3*				20 Mod Slots*				Speed x*	12,000¥	Legal

Using a variety of techniques and equipment (depending on the vehicle), including things such as superchargers, fuel distribution optimisation and parts replacement, the top speed of the vehicle is increased. More dramatic increases in top end speed require more extensive modifications to the vehicle as it is pushed far beyond its original design and limitations. Some designs can only be pushed so far. In the end, though, having that raw top-end speed can save your hoop. Speed Enhancement modification can be taken with a Rating of 1 to 3, with the Rating adding to the Speed attribute of the vehicle.
#### **Protection**
Protection modifications are all based around providing various defensive measures for the vehicle or its occupants.

*Anti-Theft System*

No self-respecting rigger wants to let their precious vehicle be stolen by some gutter punk with a screwdriver. The anti-theft system modification provides a variety of protection options, depending on the Rating.

*Rating 1*		1 Mod Slot**							500¥	Legal

Sensors are installed that detect unauthorised intrusion and alerts the owner with physical lights and sounds or sends an electronic message or both.

*Rating 2*		2 Mod Slots**							1,000¥	Legal

This includes the sensors from the previous level and adds the ability for the owner to remotely lockdown the vehicle, making it physically impossible to drive until the release code is sent by the owner. This system can be circumvented by decking the vehicle or mechanically disabling the fail safe with a Hardware + Logic [Logic] (4) Test.

*Rating 3*		4 Mod Slots**							2,500¥	Restricted Licence

With all of the previous features and the addition of an electro-shock system inflicting 9S(elec) or a gas release system equipped with a toxin of your choice.

` `*Rating 4*		6 Mod Slots**							5,000¥	Forbidden Legality

The final word in vehicle protection, it includes all of the previous level’s features and adds a remote triggered self-destruct option. The modified vehicle is reduced to medium-to-small component parts. The explosion has a base damage of 12P and -2 AP, with damage from the blast -2/m.

*Concealed Armour		3 Mod Slots/Rating			Rating x	3,000¥	Legal*

Concealed vehicle armour is installed in such a way as to be noticeable only to a trained observer (Perception (4) Test) but does not allow nearly as much protection to be installed. Each point taken for this modification adds a point to the vehicle’s Armour Value for Damage Resistance Tests. The most armour any vehicle can add is equal to the vehicle’s Body. This is true even if there are remaining modification slots on the vehicle.

*Passenger Protection System (PPS)	2 Mod Slots			Rating x	2,000¥	Legal*

The passenger protection system (PPS) is a well known and trusted series of systems and modifications made to a vehicle to keep its passengers safe in case of a collision or other “adverse vehicular situations”. PPS components include four-point harnesses, padded surfaces, quick-deploying air bags and, in some cases, fast-drying foam. A PPS has a Rating of 1 to 6, with the Rating added as a dice pool bonus to any Damage Resistance Tests by passengers from damage due to crashes or any other vehicular activity (including ramming) that is not an attack by a weapon.
#### **Weapons**
*Ammo Bins				1 Mod Slot			200¥	Restricted Licence*

Are you one of those runners that feel that any problem can be solved with enough bullets? Is “spray and pray” your personal street proverb? Then you probably want the ammo bin modification. Each ammo bin modification provides an extra 250 rounds of ammunition for one of the vehicle’s weapon mounts. The modification may be taken multiple times, providing more rounds for different weapons or even multiple times for the same weapon (if you really need a *lot* of bullets).

*Drone Rack				\* Mod Slot*

A drone rack is an indispensable tool for a rigger who relies on drones to accomplish critical tasks for their team. Drone racks consist of a metal framework or harness designed to allow for quick and easy deployment of a drone in an instant, turning a vehicle equipped with several of them into a powerful, multipurpose drone carrier. Any drone carried in any kind of drone rack can be deployed by spending a Simple Action. Each drone rack can carry a single drone of a maximum size depending on the size of the rack. Additionally, each drone rack can be standard or landing type.

All **standard** drone racks deploy drones as above but require a manual process to re-embark the drone. This involves physically putting the drone back into the rack, a process that takes 2 rounds per size category of the drone.

**Landing** drones racks have a mechanic or electromagnetic grapple system that can automatically re-embark a drone that is directly beneath or adjacent to them with a Complex Action. This can even be done while the vehicle is in motion, as long as the target drone can match the vehicle’s speed.

**Micro** drone racks can hold up to ten micro drones. **Mini** drone racks can carry one drone of up to Mini size. **Small** drone racks can carry one drone of up to Small size. **Medium** drones racks can carry one drone of up to Medium size. **Large** drone racks can carry one drone of up to Large size.

|**Drone Racks**|**Slots**|**¥**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Micro – Standard**|1|350¥|
|**Micro – Landing**|2|750¥|
|**Mini – Standard**|1|500¥|
|**Mini – Landing**|2|1,000¥|
|**Small – Standard**|2|1,000¥|
|**Small – Landing**|3|4,000¥|
|**Medium – Standard**|3|2,000¥|
|**Medium – Landing**|4|10,000¥|
|**Large – Standard**|4|4,000¥|
|**Large – Landing**|5|20,000¥|

*Gun Port				1 Mod Slot				500¥	Restricted Licence*

For those times when you want your vehicle to be less “car” and more “armoured personnel carrier”, there is the gun port mod. A gun port is a small flap or slot installed strategically in the hull of the vehicle that allows a single passenger (or the driver, if you can multitask) to shoot a hand-held weapon at a target outside the vehicle, while staying completely protected by the vehicle’s armour. The port provides a ninety-degree cone of visibility and a small stability harness that provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation. The gun port mod can be taken as many times as possible for the vehicle, through it provides no benefit beyond the amount of passengers that a vehicle can reasonably carry.

*Oil Slick Sprayer			1 Mod Slot				200¥	Restricted Licence*

Some runners say that old tricks are the best tricks and they’re the ones who most love the simple but effective oil slick sprayer. Using a few nozzles and a reservoir of slick fluid, the ground immediately behind the vehicle can be made extremely hazardous to pursuing ground-based vehicles. Activating the oil slick sprayer is a Bonus Action; following activation, any ground vehicles in pursuit at Short Range must make a Reaction + Vehicle Skill [Handling] (2) Test to avoid crashing. The oil slick sprayer has 6 charges and can be completely refilled for 50¥.
#### **Cosmetic Modifications**
Cosmetic modifications exist in the realm between vehicle modification and vehicle equipment. They are more permanent and integrated into the vehicle itself than removable equipment, yet nowhere near as invasive as any modification. As such, they are listed as a modification but do not take up any modification slots.

*Amenities*

Sometimes it’s not enough to just get from place to place – you want to travel in comfort and style. With the amenities modification, the “living conditions” of a vehicle are upgraded to provide a more pleasant experience. A standard vehicle provides accommodations equivalent to Low Lifestyle.

*Rating 1*				0 Mod Slot**						0¥	Legal

A standard vehicle provides default amenities.

*Rating 2*				0 Mod Slots**						500¥	Legal

The vehicle is equipped with comfortable fabric seats, pleasant ergonomics and decorating and basic AR entertainment options.

*Rating 3*				0 Mod Slots**						1,000¥	Legal

The vehicle has seating made from fine materials and temperature controlled with refreshment options available. There is also a full suite of Matrix and non-electronic entertainment options to keep anyone entertained for hours.

` `*Rating 4*				0 Mod Slots**						10,000¥	Legal

Every aspect of the vehicle maximises comfort: the seats keep you warm and massage you according to a scan of your muscle tension and they are made of a non-synthetic material (possibly some kind of dead animal hide). The refreshment unit contains exotic alcohol and real food, along with access to every Matrix entertainment channel or game available.

*Enhanced Image Screens	0 Mod Slots						5,000¥	Legal*

While every vehicle in the 2070s features some degree of imaging screens to communicate important vehicle information, many riggers and vehicle owners want to enhance that image displaying capability. With enhanced image screens, every sufficiently flat surface on a vehicle (including windows) can display an electronic image or video. These images are hyper realistic and can be used to project a false image of the outside world in an attempt to deceive passengers. A Perception Test with a -4 penalty is required to notice that the images are false. Enhanced image screens can be used to display any visual feed on a PAN, perfect for team members unable to unwilling to use their AR or tie their commlink or deck into the same PAN. They can also be used for plain-old entertainment. A vehicle with enhanced image screens can display any and all Matrix AROs that they can see/access on the inside of their vehicle, making them visible to character who do not have AR equipped.

*Interior Cameras		0 Mod Slots						2,000¥	Legal*

In the course of jumping through multiple vehicles and taking in multiple streams of information from different sources, a rigger can easily lose contact with their immediate surroundings – namely, the interior of their own vehicle. As a result, many riggers install interior cameras into their vehicle so they can easily keep track of their own meat body and any passengers in the vehicle by routing the feed from the interior cameras into their PAN. Interior cameras allow a rigger to make a standard Perception Test to notice anyone or anything inside of their vehicle, even while they are in full VR mode.

*Rigger Interface		0 Mod Slots						1,000¥	Legal*

By the 2070s rigger control of vehicles have become so common that even if a rigger adaptation isn’t installed as standard for a vehicle, it can easily be added after-market. This modification allows a rigger to jump into a vehicle and control it with a full sensory experience. This includes installation of the “black box” that processes the sensory impressions for human consumption, along with a suite of sensors and relays connected to various parts of the vehicle.

*Searchlight			0 Mod Slots						800¥	Legal*

Hey, sometimes your needs are as simple as having a light to shine on things when it gets dark. The searchlight modification installs a high-powered light mounted somewhere on the exterior of the vehicle, capable of all-around movement for wherever it happens to be mounted. It can be operated remotely or manually, as long as it is physically accessible. When activated and pointed in the appropriate direction, the searchlight reduces the penalties due to darkness by one step. 
### **Drones**
The skill used to pilot a microdrone varies from drone to drone.
#### **Microdrones**
*Sony Goldfish									500¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2/4|1W|1|0|0|2|2|0|

Sized to realistic proportions and capable of dives of up to four metres deep, the Goldfish is a prime example of an entry-level water drone, suitable as a trainer for youths who look toward a future as robotic operators or hobbyists who wish to explore local water holes below the surface. This drone is operated with the Pilot Watercraft skill.

*Sikorsky-Bell Microskimmer							1,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3|3P|1|0|0|3|3|0|

Quiet and durable, this disc-shaped skimmer is smaller than a frisbee and can even skim over water. It moves with small and rather weak hoverjets. It is easier to sport than the Kanmushi but still very small. It is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill; the hovercraft specialisation applies.

*Shiawase Kanmushi								1,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|2G|1|0|0|3|3|0|

This is a four-legged “bug” crawler drone that is hard to tell from a natural insect at a glance. It’s ideal for penetrating confined areas and its gecko-tipped extremities and light weight render it capable of crawling on walls and ceilings; it is, however, quite fragile and merely being stepped on swatted can easily destroy it. This drone is operated with the Pilot Walker skill.
#### **Minidrones**
*MCT Fly-Spy									2,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|3P|2|1|0|3|3|1|

This Mitsuhama drone is the size and shape of a large insect but can achieve substantially better altitudes It can serve in an “eye in the sky” role and is handy for shadowing people, given the fact that it’s relatively hard to spot. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

*Renraku Gerbil									2,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4/2|2G|1|1|0|2|2|1|

A tiny, wheeled drone, the Gerbil is sized to travel through not only any ventilation shaft but most pipes, allowing it to enter a surprisingly large number of otherwise secure areas. It’s surprisingly quick and nimble, able to evade most pursuit from metahumans long enough to find a hidey-hole.

*Evo Culture Capture								3,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|1P|1|1|0|2|3|1|

A simple, single-fan vectored thrust drone, the Culture Capture is a cheaper version of the professional camera drones used by most major trideo broadcasters. The fan traded off speed for stability and whisper-quiet operation, allowing the camera to focus on the target without overwhelming the sound with the typical whirly-whoosh. Hugely popular with the would-be-influencer crowd, where it follows them everywhere and records their day, allowing them to do live updates or edit the footage later.

*Standard Upgrades: Clearsight (2) Autosoft*

*Festo Pigeon 2.0								3,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|2P|1|1|0|2|2|1|

Saeder-Krupp’s Festo subsidiary mastered the art of lifelike simulation for drone, producing the first realistic flying “bird drone” almost fifty years ago. The design has continued to be refined over the decades and now stands as a work of art. The baseline model is a chrome-plated beauty but a more lifelike model is available and is commonly used as a surveillance drone. This drone is operated with the Pilot Exotic Vehicle skill.

*Standard Upgrades: Realistic Features (1)*

*Ares Cloudship									4,000¥		Restricted Licence*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2|0R|0|1|0|2|4|1|

Solar-powered and hydrogen-filled, the Ares Cloudship is a long-duration observation drone constructed with transparent and radar-invisible materials, allowing it to hover in place for days, even weeks, rather than the hours that a conventional drone can manage. The trade-off, of course, is that the Cloudship is completely vulnerable if detected and unable to flee. While the Cloudship’s balloon is nearly as large as kitchen table when inflated, when deflated the entire unit is smaller than a bowling pin.

*Cyberspace Designs Dragonfly							4,000¥		Restricted Licence*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|4|2P|2|1|3|3|2|0|

Perhaps the smallest drone-hunting drone in production today, the Dragonfly is designed to follow surveillance drones anywhere they hide and bring them down. A sleek quad-copter design with in-body rotors that are protected from collisions in tight corners, the Dragonfly comes pre-equipped with a chomping “beak” of blades, allowing it to shear through the wings or body of other mini- or micro-drones, ripping them from the sky. Against larger drones, the Dragonfly can swarm, nipping away in small bites but it isn’t designed to cut through any appreciable level of armour plating. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

*Standard Upgrades: Melee Bite (Acc 3, Reach -, DV 3P, AP-2), Targeting (Melee) Autosoft*

*Aztechnology Hedgehog								8,000¥		Forbidden Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3|1G|1|1|0|4|3|0|

A specialised sub-design of the Aztechnology Crawler, the Hedgehog is the leading security-sniffing drone on the market today. Intended to find opposition command, control and communication broadcasts, it can listen is passively while running decrypting software. Parked in a hidden location, it can eavesdrop for up to 48 hours on a single charge, gather data by the gigapulse. This drone is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill.

*Standard Upgrades: Electronic Warfare (2) Autosoft*

*Horizon Mini-Zep								2,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2|0P|0|2|0|2|2|4|

A simple, lighter-than-air drone, the Mini-Zep is only notable due to the electrochromatic coating along the airbag’s surface. This allows the Mini-Zep to be programmed with ads for virtually anything and they can either be scrolled through or changed completely with a simple wireless signal from the home office. They also have a small radio transmitter inside, allowing them to spam AR ads to any nearby commlink. Due to being a LtA drone pushed gently with fans, they can easily loiter for eighter hours, giving maximum eyeball time to their ads. In emergency situations, they can even do live rebroadcasts of weather alerts, law enforcement APBs or anything else.

*Standard Upgrades: Electrochromatic Coating*

*Renraku Jardinero								2,000¥		Legal*

|**Handling**|**Speed**|**Accel**|**Body**|**Armour**|**Pilot**|**Sensor**|**Mod Pts**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|2/4|1G|1|2|0|2|2|1|

Renraku has numerous lines all based on the same chassis (which is why the Jardinero has the wrong suspension for the work it’s doing) but the Jardinero is the top-selling, so gets the nod. The basic model is simply an automated lawn mower, handling all the upkeep of suburban grass with silent electrical motors and whisper-quiet blades, when returning to a solar recharge station until told to mow again. Other versions handle vacuum duties, floor polishing, repainting parking lots and similarly menial jobs.

The mechanic’s best friend. These little guys are amazing. At the core, it’s a simple dome-headed, three-wheeled drone with a single functional arm but they’re just about perfect for pitching in around the garage. They’re advanced enough to be trusted with simple work, banging out dents, changing tyres, checking the oil and so on but they are also handy assistants for harder work, presenting you with tools when you need them, keeping vehicle schematics displayed on their chest screen and keeping an eye on things when you’re beneath an undercarriage. They even have good speakers for use as a mobile stereo system. Evo hired Renraku to create a wide array of autosofts for them, giving them an option for repairing anything, handling electrical or construction work, even serving as butlers at parties.

*Standard Upgrades: Drone Arm (Strength 4, Agility 2), Automotive Mechanic Toolkit, Automotive Mechanic (2) Autosoft*

One of the oldest security drones still in production, the Ferret is a small patrol drone used as a cheap alternative to security guards. Armed with a flashlight and a taser, it’s perfectly able to handle drunk college students and would-be trespassers but shadowrunners are a different breed. That said, they see wide use in college campuses, shopping malls and many homes, serving as basic light security. It should be notes that they’re awful off-road and so they need to stay on established paths.

*Standard Upgrades: Mini Weapon Mount, Defiance Shocker, 4 Taser Darts, Flashlight*

You’ve seen these quad-copters around for years but I bet none of you knew what the actual name was. Renraku keeps the marketing for these things aimed at wholesale, not retail. The Pelican is a simple flying drone with a modular storage compartment underhung. Heated or cooled, they come in sizes for pizza, noodle boxes and more and are used by everyone from Pizza Hop to Heli-Taco to Heavenly Noodles, to make sure you get your food in thirty minutes or less anywhere in the sprawl.

Able to both slither and swim, the Sewer Snake’s long, narrow design allows it to access areas that differently shaped drones cannot and handle whatever environmental conditions it faces. The Snake’s surface is coated with several small gecko grip points, allowing it to climb vertically when pressed and it can handle the pressure of a ten-metre dive. There’s little room for further modification but in terms of eyes that can go anywhere, you’re hard-pressed to beat the Snake.

An unusual “limpet” drone stored in some Knight Errant police cruisers, the P5 is a small drone that sacrifices durability for raw speed. When at top speed, the batteries last a whopping ten minutes but that’s more than enough for this little beast. The P5 drops down from beneath the cruiser, races ahead, then magnetically attaches itself to the undercarriage of the pursued vehicle. This allows KE to follow the wireless signal instead of engaging in a high-speed chase. Simple, but effective.

“Worried about your loves ones being victims of a late night? Stay at work safely while Lone Star guards your castle!” Notice the subtle dig at their primary law enforcement rivals? Lone Star is unique in the home-security drone market in offering a pistol-armed drone, as opposed to the non-lethal options other security drones carry as standard arms. Much more common in CAS than the UCAS, the Castle Guard ads push that lethal force is the only true way to keep your family safe while you’re grinding away at your job. The Guard comes with four SmartSafety bracelets to ensure that it can’t accidentally fire at family members and additional bracelets, or pet collars, can be purchased for 50 nuyen each. The drone itself is average-sized, four-wheeled and has enough armour to turn aside small arms or baseball bats but not so much that one going wild can’t easily be stopped by heavier firepower. The marketing on these things is damned impressive, even if the actual drone is average at best.

With its wings folded up for transport, this VSTOL stealth craft is only the size of a cyberdeck. When it is deployed, it is the size of a large hawk or other bird of prey. Its patented signature-limiting technology makes it a favourite of intelligence agencies and shadowrunners; radar systems and visual and audio Perception Tests all receive a -3 dice pool penalty to spot the Optic-X2. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

There are a few people in this world who can’t manage cybernetics. Some are mages, some have unique nerve designs, while others believe that chrome “eats your soul” and refuse it. Some of these people can’t walk, due to either disability or infirmity. Enter the Steed, a motorised chair with wheels that can be controlled by a simple trode-based DNI. Street-legal in the city, it can also move around inside a building with ease.

Originally more of a technological “Can we make this?” from the early days of drone research than anything, the Cheetah is the world’s fastest quad mech, matching speed with any living animal and many of today’s cars. This quad is based off the African cheetah (obviously) and trades manoeuvrability for raw speed. The claws are just for traction but the Cheetah comes with working jaws that are quite able to chomp down on metahumans if needed. Rarely, buyers replace the jaws with a taser-equipped head whose teeth are just for show.

The LEBD-1 was a Ford-built police drone that never found a market with Knight Errant, Lone Star or Eagle Security. It was quietly discontinued after dismal sales. Renraku picked up the plans for virtually nothing and redesigned it somewhat for use with their Neo-PD subsidiary. The new LEBD-2 builds on the reliable roto-drone’s ability to be slotted into a charging mount on the back of a patrol car to create one-officer, one-drone teams, combining a human’s gut instincts and friendliness with a drone’s expendability and perfect recording of events. The drone can be sent to flank a home, provide fire support via the included taser and even help with paperwork. Most officers are as loyal to their drone partner as a K-9 officer to their dog and assaulting an LEBD-2 is treated as an attack on an officer in most Neo-PD subsidiaries.

### **Drone Modifications**
Drones can be modified using the following drone modifications.

*Drone Weapon Mounts				\* Mod Slot*

Probably the most common drone mod is finding a way to strap weapons on to one. Due to the small size of drones, standard vehicle mounts aren’t always appropriate, so drones use weapon mounts from the following chart. Each weapon mount added uses up the listed number of Mod Points (MP), allowing a drone to sometimes mount several smaller weapons rather than a single large one. All weapon mounts are at least Restricted, while some are Forbidden outside of military use. In addition, authorities are quite interested in what weapons are mounted in them! In most nations, it’s illegal for a drone to mount anything other than non-lethal weaponry.

|**Weapon Mounts**||||
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Mount**|MP|¥|Weapon|
|**Micro**|0|400|Single-shot bullet or dart|
|**Mini**|1|800|Hold-out pistol, Light pistol, small melee weapons, single-shot grenade|
|**Small**|2|1,600|Heavy Pistol, Machine Pistol|
|**Standard**|3|2,400|Sub-machine gun, under-barrel grenade launcher|
|**Large**|4|3,200|Shotgun, Hunting Rifle, Assault Rifle, Grenade Launcher|

*Option: Pop-out Drone Mounts			\* Mod Slot*

Ordinarily a weapon mount is quite obvious, as it the weapon mounted therein. Since shadowrunners tend to have quite illegal things mounted on their drones, this can be problematic, as you might imagine. There are two disguises for weapon mounts that can be used on drones. The first are blow-away panels. There are single coverings that are designed to be ejected just before the weapon is triggered. Once blown away, the weapon is left exposed and obvious, but this method is both cheap and easy. Blow-away panels may be installed with a simple Kit and cost 25¥ x the Mod Points of the weapon mount. A Perception + Intuition [Mental] (2) Test will reveal that there’s something covered, but not what it is. Once the panel is blown away, it cannot be recovered.

The other option is “pop-up” weapons (or pop-out, or pop-under as the case may be). These are weapons stored inside the body of the drone, deployed on command (requiring a Bonus Action), then retracted against with another command (also a Bonus Action). Much harder to detect (requiring a Perception (4) Test) and re-usable, the mechanisms are a bit cumbersome and complex, adding 1 to the MP consumed by a weapon thus concealed. Pop-up mounts may be installed with a Shop and they cost 100¥ x the increased MP of the weapon.

*Option: Expanded Drone Ammunition Bay		1 or 2 Mod Slots		50¥/500¥*

Unlike normal vehicular weapons, the tight constraints of a drone’s body offer limited ammunition reserves. Any weapon mounted on a drone uses the weapon’s normal ammunition limits, rather than the expanded version of a vehicle’s. There are, however, two optional ammunition bays for drones. The first is simply adding a second bin, which holds the same number of ammunition as the weapon ordinarily holds and a small switching unit to feed the weapon when one runs dry. This may be installed with a Kit, uses 1 MP and costs 50¥.

The other option is a full belt-feed system, replacing the weapon’s normal ammunition feed mechanism entirely. This requires a Shop, makes the weapon belt-fed and provides enough room for an entire belt of 100 rounds. Additional expanded ammunition bays may then be added, each holding another 100-round belt. A belt-feed system requires a Shop, uses 2 MP and costs 500¥.

**<a name="_toc218024820"></a>COMBAT**\

======================================
### **Combat Turn Sequence**
Combat encounters occur in three-second **Combat Turns**.

During each **Combat Turn**, characters act in order determined by their **Initiative Score** (highest first, lowest last).

Initiative is fluid and changes both within a Combat Turn and between Combat Turns.

The character with the highest Initiative Score takes their **Action Phase** first. If there is a tie in Initiative Scores, compare the Attributes (Edge, Reaction, Intuition), with the highest going first. In the event this is still a tie, actions are determined simultaneously.

*Note*: **Wound modifiers** affect the **Initiative Score** as soon as the wound is inflicted.

In an **Action Phase**, a character may take two **Simple Actions** or one **Complex Action**. In addition, characters may take one **Bonus Action** each **Action Phase**. Characters may replace each **Simple Action** with an additional **Bonus Action**.

|**One Action Phase:**|||||||
| :-: | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Complex Action|OR|Simple Action\*|OR|Simple Action|OR|Bonus Action|
|||Simple Action\*||Bonus Action||Bonus Action|
|Bonus Action||Bonus Action||Bonus Action||Bonus Action|

\**Only one of these can be an Attack Action.*

When these actions are complete, reduce the character’s **Initiative Score** by 10. If the **Initiative Score** is zero or less, the character has completed their actions this **Combat Turn**.

A character can **Delay** their **Action Phase** to act later in the **Combat Turn**. Characters can choose to go after the last character’s Action Phase. When they decide to act, they replace their normal **Initiative Score** with the one on which they act, however actions they take may receive a -1 dice pool penalty.
### **Combat Movement**
Basic combat movement (walking) does not use an action. Running uses a Bonus Action. Sprinting is a Complex Action.

A character’s walk rate and run rate are determined by the table below. This is the distance they can move during their Combat Turn. As soon as a character exceeds their Walk Rate, they are considered Running until the end of the Combat Turn. Running characters must use a Bonus Action in each Initiative Pass they are considered running. Characters cannot exceed their Run Rate in a Combat Turn without making a Sprinting Test.

|**Metatype**|**Walk Rate**|**Run Rate**|**Sprint Increase**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Dwarf, Troll**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+1m/hit|
|**Elf, Human, Ork**|Agility x2|Agility x4|+2m/hit|

**Walking** (up to Walk Rate) – Free action – No modifiers.

**Running** (up to Run Rate) – Bonus action – Suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to all actions (except Sprinting Tests).

Ranged attacks against this character suffer a -2 dice pool penalty.

If a running character makes a charge into melee combat, they gain a +4 dice pool bonus (making a net bonus of +2 when combined with the general penalty).

**Sprinting** – Complex Action – Running + Strength [Physical] Test.

Characters are allowed a maximum number of Sprinting tests equal to half their Running Skill per Combat Turn (minimum 1).

Suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to all actions (except Sprinting Tests).

Ranged attacks against this character suffer a -4 dice pool penalty.

If you Sprint for multiple consecutive Combat Turns or during multiple Action Phases of the same Combat Turn, you risk taking fatigue damage. For every consecutive Action Phase or Combat Turn in which you use the Sprint action, you take a cumulative 1S DV of fatigue damage. If you’re only running, instead of sprinting, this damage is taken every 3 minutes.
### **Bonus Actions**
Bonus actions are relatively simple, nearly automatic actions that require little effort to accomplish. Examples include saying a phrase, dropping an object, gesturing or walking.

A character may take one Bonus Action during their own Action Phase or at some point later in the Initiative Pass. A character may only take a Bonus Action prior to their first Action Phase if they are not surprised. Multiple Bonus Actions may be allowed by the gamesmaster if the situation seems reasonable (e.g. dropping an object and speaking a phase).

**Drop Object**: A character may drop a held object as a Bonus Action. If holding an object in each hand, both objects may be dropped as a single Bonus Action.

**Drop Prone/Kneel**: A character may kneel or drop prone as a Bonus Action as long as they are not surprised.

**Gesture**: A character may communicate with a few quick gestures as a Bonus Action.

**Run**: Running uses a Bonus Action (see Combat Movement above).

**DNI Use Device**: A character may use a Bonus Action to activate, deactivate or switch the mode on a device they are linked to by a direct neural interface (DNI). This includes changing the firing mode of a smart-linked firearm (safety, single shot, burst, full-auto). Note that it takes longer to interact with some devices, as noted in individual gear descriptions.

**Speak/Text/Transmit Phase**: One short phrase of verbal communication is a Bonus Action. Characters who are equipped to send text messages through their commlinks may also send short messages as a Bonus Action, longer if they are using a direct neural interface (DNI).

**Multiple Attacks**: A character may use a Bonus Action to attack multiple targets in a single action by splitting their dice pool. This action must be combined with a Fire Weapon Action, Throw Weapon Action, Melee Attack Action.
### **Simple Actions**
A Simple Action is one step more complicated than a Bonus Action and requires more concentration to attempt. During an Action Phase, a character may take two Simple actions, though **only one can be an attack action**. A character may also take a Bonus Action with each Simple action.

**Pick Up/Put Down Object**: A character may pick up an object within reach or put down one they were holding as a Simple Action. This action means that some care is taken to put the object down or pick it up. Just dropping an object is a Bonus Action, but items that get dropped are more likely to be damaged than items that are set down.

**Stand Up**: Using a Simple Action, a character who is lying down or prone may stand up. If the character is seriously wounded and attempting to stand, they may need to succeed in a Body + Willpower (2) Test to do so.

**Take Cover**: A character may use a Simple Action to take cover behind nearby objects or terrain, gaining a cover bonus to their defence test, as long as they are not surprised.

**Take Aim**: A character may take aim with a ready firearm, bow or throwing weapon as a Simple Action. The benefits of a taking aim are lost if the character takes any other kind of action – including a Bonus Action – at any time before attacking. Taking aim applies a +1 dice pool modifier *or* a +1 Accuracy increase to the Attack Test.

If the character is using image magnification or a targeting scope, Take Aim must be used to line up the shot in order to receive the bonus from the item.

**Use Device**: A character may use a Simple Action to activate, deactivate or switch the mode on a device through a control device such as a commlink. This includes changing the firing mode of a firearm (safety, single shot, burst, full-auto). Note that it takes longer to interact with some devices, as noted in individual gear descriptions.

**Ready Weapon**: A character may ready a weapon as a Simple Action. The weapon may be a firearm, melee weapon, throwing weapon, ranged weapon or mounted or vehicular weapon. Readying entails drawing a firearm from a holster, drawing a throwing or melee weapon from a sheath, picking up any kind of weapon or generally preparing any kind of weapon for use. A weapon must be ready before it can be used. Weapons not held in a traditional holster may require a Complex Action to ready at the gamesmaster’s discretion.

A character may ready a number of small throwing weapons, such as throwing knives or shuriken, equal to half their Agility (round up) per Ready Weapon action.

**Quick Draw**: A character may attempt to quick-draw a light-pistol, light-pistol-sized weapon or small throwing weapon and immediately fire it by using a Quick Draw Simple Action. For a character to successfully draw the weapon, the player must make a (Weapon Skill) + Reaction [Physical] (3) Test. If the test is successful, the character draws the weapon and fires as a single Simple Action. If the test fails, the weapon is drawn but cannot be fired with the same action. If there is a glitch, the weapon is stuck in the holster or dropped and no more actions are allowed. In a critical glitch, a drawn blade may be fumbled out of the character’s reach or a pistol accidentally fired while still in the holster; the gamemaster decides the exact nature of the screw-up. Two weapons may be quick-drawn and fired simultaneously, but the dice pool is split and off-hand penalties apply.

**Fire Bow**: Firing a single arrow from a loaded bow is a Simple Action. **The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**.

**Fire Firearm**: A character may fire a readied firearm in single-shot, burst-fire, semi-automatic or full-auto mode as a Simple Action. **The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**.

If a character has one weapon in each hand, they may fire both at once by also expending a Bonus Action. The off-hand modifier applies. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

When taken as Simple Actions, burst-fire fires 3 bullets, while full-auto fire 6 bullets.

**Reload Bow**: To nock a single arrow is a Simple Action.

**Remove Clip**: It is a Simple Action to remove a clip from a ready firearm and stash it in a readily available location.

**Reload Clip**: It is a Simple Action to grab a readily available fresh clip and slam it into the weapon.

**Throw Weapon**: A character may throw a ready throwing weapon as a Simple Action. **The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**.

Multiple readied throwing weapons (up to half your relevant Combat Skill) can be thrown at a target within Short or Medium range by also expending a Bonus Action. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

**Shift Perception**: A character capable of Astral Perception may shift perception to or from Astral Space as a Simple Action.

**Activate Focus**: A character may activate a focus they are carrying with a Simple Action.

**Call Spirit**: A character may call a spirit that has already been summoned and placed on standby as a Simple Action.

**Command Spirit**: Issuing a command to a single spirit or group of spirits under a summoner’s control is a Simple Action.

**Dismiss Spirit**: Freeing a spirit from your control is a Simple action. It does not immediately send the spirit back to its home plane but instead frees it to do as it chooses.
### **Complex Actions**
A Complex Action requires intense concentration and/or finesse. Only one Complex Action is possible per Action Phase.

**Sprint**: A character may use a Complex action to increase their Running Rate and making a Sprinting Test.

**Escape Combat**: With a little room to move, agile character can avoid the Interception attempts of their opponents without engaging in combat. Using a Complex Action with their movement, they can make an Agility + Acrobatics (2) [Physical] Test. Each hit above the threshold allows the character to move past one opponent.

**Fire Mounted or Vehicle Weapon**: A character may fire a previously readied mounted or vehicle weapon by taking a Complex Action.

**Rigger Jump In**: A character with a Vehicle Control Rig (VCR) and rigger adapted vehicle may jump in to control the vehicle with a Complex Action.

**Reload Firearm**: Weapons that are belt fed, break action, cylinder, drum, internal magazine, muzzle loaders or use a speed loader are reloaded using a Complex action.

**Melee Attack**: A character may make a melee attack as a Complex Action. **The character may not take any other attack actions in the same Action Phase**. A character may also attack multiple targets within melee range by also expending a Bonus Action. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

**Melee Teamwork**: A character may make an Opposed Melee + Agility [Physical] v Intuition Test to give the next melee attacker a bonus equal to their net hits. The next ally could instead use these hits as a bonus on their own Melee Teamwork Test, hoping to build the amount of hits they are passing on to the eventual attacker. Three Melee Teamwork attacks can be made before a standard attack must be made. This is a good option for less-skilled attackers to help out their melee-oriented teammates.

**Fire Full-Auto Weapon**: A character may fire a readied firearm in Full-Auto fire mode with a Complex Action. When fired as a Complex Action, Full-Auto uses 10 bullets. Remember the effects of cumulative recoil when using these fire modes. And good fragging luck!

**Fire Long Burst or Semi-Auto Burst**: A character may fire a readied firearm in a Long Burst or Semi-Auto Burst with a Complex Action. Remember the effects of cumulative recoil with using these fire modes.

A character may attack multiple targets within Short or Medium range by also expending a Bonus Action. The dice pool is calculated with all modifiers, then split as evenly as possible between attacks and each attack is then handled separately.

If a character has one weapon in each hand, they may fire both at once by also expending a Bonus Action. The off-hand modifier applies.

**Astral Projection**: A character capable of Astral Projection may shift their consciousness to the astral plane as a Complex Action.

**Manifest**: A character may manifest or unmanifest their astral form as a Complex Action.

**Banish Spirit**: A character may enter into a Banishing contest with a spirit as a Complex Action.

**Cast Spell**: A character may cast a spell as a Complex Action.

**Summoning**: A character may summon a spirit to assist them with a Complex Action.
### **Interrupt Actions**
Interrupt Actions are taken outside a character’s Action Phase. A character may only take an Interrupt Action prior to their first Action Phase if they are not surprised. When these actions are complete, reduce the character’s **Initiative Score** by the amount listed. If a character does not have enough Initiative remaining, they cannot take an Interrupt Action. If the **Initiative Score** is reduced to zero or less, the character has completed their actions this **Combat Turn**.

**Block**: -5 Initiative. A character may choose to use their own unarmed combat skill to block incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action. Add the character’s Unarmed Combat Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

**Parry**: -5 Initiative. A character may choose to use their own melee combat skill to deflect incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. Add the character’s Melee Weapon Skill Rating to their Defence Test. Bonus die, such as from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test.

**Dodge**: -5 Initiative. A character may choose to use their own acrobatics skill to dodge incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. Add the character’s Acrobatics Skill Rating to their Defence Test.

**Intercept**: -0 Initiative. A character may take an Interrupt Action to intercept an opponent who attempts to move past them, break out of melee combat or fire a ranged weapon in melee combat. Prone combatants cannot intercept. The Intercept Action allows a character to make a melee attack out of turn (this may be an unarmed attack). If a character is wielding a firearm, they may choose to strike with it as a club using the Club skill. If, after their Resistance Test, the character attempting to pass takes damage equal to their Body, they are intercepted and cannot continue their movement.

**Full Defence**: -10 Initiative. A character may choose to focus on deliberately avoiding incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. This action adds the character’s Willpower to their Defence Tests for the entire Combat Turn. This bonus is also cumulative with other Interrupt Actions. Full Defence actions may be taken at any time, even before the character’s Action Phase as an Interrupt Action, as long as the character is not surprised.
### **Combat Resolution**
Combat is handled as an Opposed Test between the attacker and defender. The attacker rolls Combat Skill + Attribute +/- modifiers [Limit]. Ranged weapons have an Accuracy score that acts as a Limit for that weapon. Weapons that are in poor condition or broken may have their Accuracy reduced. Melee weapons use the Inherent Limit [Physical] and do not have an Accuracy rating, although improvised weapons may incur an Accuracy penalty (e.g. -1 for a golf club or frying pan and -2 for a bar stool or a bench). Unarmed attacks use the Inherent Limit [Physical] and do not have an Accuracy rating.

A standard Defence Test (Reaction + Intuition) does not take any actions (although the defender can choose to Dodge, Parry, Block or go on Full Defence). If the attacker scores more hits than the defender, the attack hits the target. On a tie, there is a grazing hit which does not do any damage, but allows certain contact-only attacks (poisons, shocks, touch-only combat spells, etc) to trigger their effects.
### **Combat Modifiers**
If the defender is inside a moving vehicle, they gain a +3 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If the defender is prone, they suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to their defence. This modifier does not apply to defending against ranged attacks unless the attacker is extremely close (5 metres of less).

If the attacker has longer Reach, the defender suffers a -1 dice pool penalty to their defence for each point of net Reach.

If the attacker has an ally engaged in the same melee, they gain a +1 dice pool bonus to their attack test.

If the defender has defended against a previous attack they suffer a -2 dice pool penalty to their defence for each previous attack.

If the defender is running, they receive a +2 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If the defender has partial cover, they receive a +2 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If the defender has good cover, they receive a +2 dice pool bonus to their defence.

If a defender is in melee and the target of a ranged attack, they suffer a -3 dice pool penalty to their defence against the ranged attack.

If an attacker is making a ranged attack while in melee combat, they suffer a -3 penalty to their attack rolls.

If making an attack at a Micro target (Insect, Microdrone) -3

If making an attack at a Mini target (Small Rodents, Minidrones) -2

If making an attack at a Small target (Cat, Small Drone) -1

If making an attack at a Large target (Horse, Car) +1

If making an attack at a Huge target (Dump Truck, Wyvern) +2

### **Armour**
Armour is used with the Body attribute to make Damage Resistance Tests. Add the attacker’s net hits to the DV of the weapon to determine the modified Damage Value (DV). The Armour Rating of the armour is modified by the attack’s Armour Penetration (AP) value.  If the modified (DV) of an attack causing Physical damage is less than the AP-modified armour rating, then the attack causes Stun damage instead of Physical damage. If a character is wearing more than one piece of armour at a time, the value of the highest armour piece applies for determining Armour. As long as the modified Armour Value is positive, the defender rolls Body + modified Armour to resist damage. Otherwise, the defender only rolls Body. Each hit scored reduces the modified DV by 1. If the DV is reduced to 0 or less, no damage is inflicted. Remaining DV is applied to the target’s Condition Monitor. Each point of DV equals 1 box of damage. Wound Modifiers may come into effect as a result of the damage (see below). Characters may also need to check for knockdown.
### **Knockdown**
If a character takes more damage from a single attack than their Physical Limit (Stun or Physical, after a Damage Resistance Test) then the attack knocks them down. Any character who takes 10 or more damage after a Resistance Test in a single attack is always knocked down.

Some weapons (such as Gel Rounds) reduce the amount of damage needed to determine knockdown.

If a character is seriously wounded and attempting to stand, they must succeed in a Body + Willpower (2) Test to do so (wound modifiers apply to this test).
### **Damage**
Damage in *Shadowrun* is defined as Physical or Stun. Each type of damage if tracked on a separate Condition Monitor.

Physical damage has a “P” following the Damage Value. Physical damage takes a longer time to heal. The number of boxes in the Physical Condition Monitor equals (Body /2) +8.

Stun damage has an “S” following the Damage Value. Stun damage takes a shorter time to heal. The number of boxes in the Stun Condition Monitor equals (Willpower /2) +8.
### **Wound Modifiers**
Wound modifiers are accumulated with every third box of damage and are cumulative between damage tracks and with other negative modifiers such as spells or adverse conditions. Wound modifiers are applied to all tests except those about reducing the number of boxes you’re about to take on your Condition Monitor (such as damage resistance, resisting direct combat spells, toxin resistance, and so on). The Wound Modifier penalty is also applied to a character’s Initiative modifier and Initiative Score during combat.
### **Exceeding the Condition Monitor**
When the total number of boxes in a damage track (Physical or Stun) are filled in and damage still remains to be applied, one of two things happen:

- - If the damage is Stun, it carries over into the Physical damage track. For every two full boxes of excess Stun damage, carry over 1 box to the Physical damage track.
- - If a character takes more Physical damage than they have boxes of Physical damage, they are near death. If the damage overflows by more than the character’s Body attribute they die.

Characters also take an additional box of damage every (Body) minutes while they have overflow damage.
### **Fatigue Damage**
Fatigue damage is Stun damage you incur through doing something strenuous or for being in the middle of something stressful. It’s caused by harsh environments, hard exertion and drek like that. Fatigue damage is resisted with Body + Willpower, not with armour. Fatigue damage cannot be healed while the condition causing it still exists.



**<a name="_toc218024821"></a>USING FIREARMS**\

==============================================
Guns, guns, guns!!! Firearms come in a variety of shapes and sizes but they all do pretty much the same thing: throw high-velocity projectiles designed to damage whatever they hit. Whether this is spraying lead downrange or firing a single high-precision shot, the results can be deadly. Which, generally, is the plan.
### **Firing Modes**
The first thing we need to look at when it comes to firearms in the firing mode. A weapon’s firing mode determines how quickly each round is ready to fire, how quickly you can pull the trigger and what happens when you do.

|**Mode**|**Attack**|**Action**|**DV**|**Defence Mod.**|**Rounds Used**|**Recoil**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|**Single-Shot (SS)**|Single Shot|Simple|0|0|1|No Recoil|
|**Semi-Automatic (SA)**|Single Shot|Simple|0|0|1|1|
||Double Tap|Simple|+1|0|2|2|
||Semi-Automatic Burst (SB)|Complex|0|-2|3|3|
|**Burst-Fire (BF)**|Burst Fire (BF)|Simple|0|-2|3|3|
||Aimed Burst|Simple|+1|0|3|3|
|**Full-Auto (FA)**|Full-Auto|Simple|0|-5|6|6|
||Long Full-Auto (LFA)|Complex|0|-9|10|10|
||Suppressive Fire|Complex||||No Recoil|
#### **Single Shot (SS)**
Firing a Single Shot (SS) weapon uses a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attacking Simple Action in the same Action Phase. SS weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Bonus Action if the attacker is wielding two such weapons. Single Shot weapons include bolt-action rifles, single-action revolvers, pump-action shotguns, lever-action rifles and some large weapons that need extra time to chamber a fresh round due to the cartridge’s size.

Single Shot fire assumes another round is readied with each shot as long as rounds are available in the gun.

Single Shot (SS) weapons do not suffer from cumulative recoil when fired in single shot mode. Recoil penalties apply when using the Multiple Attacks Action.

`	`***[Attack] Single Shot*	 		*Defence Modifier 0	Rounds Used 1	 	Recoil -***

`	`[Simple Action] A single shot at the target.
#### **Semi-Automatic (SA)**
Semi-automatic weapons fire a round every time the trigger is pulled and automatically chamber a fresh round after each shot. Semi-automatic weapons fire a single round with a Simple Action but cannot combine that with any other Attack Action in the same Action Phase. Semi-automatic weapons can take advantage of the Multiple Attacks Bonus Action if the shooter has two semi-automatic weapons.

They also have the option of using a Semi-Automatic Burst.

`	`***[Attack] Single Shot*	 		*Defence Modifier 0	Rounds Used 1	 	Recoil 1***

`	`[Simple Action] A single shot at the target.

`	`***[Attack] Double Tap*	 *DV +1*		*Defence Modifier 0	Rounds Used 2	 	Recoil 2***

`	`[Simple Action] A rapid pair of well-aimed shots fired to increase damage instead of making it harder to avoid.

`	`***[Attack] Semi-Automatic Burst (SB)* 	*Defence Modifier -2	Rounds Used 3	 	Recoil 3***

`	`[Complex Action] Semi-Automatic Burst mode is three semi-automatic shots taken in quick succession. Semi-Automatic weapons can fire a burst of three rounds with a Complex Action. With more shots going downrange, they increase the chance that a bullet will hit.
#### **Burst Fire (BF)**
Burst Fire (BF) weapons are usually SMGs or assault rifles but some pistols and shotguns can be modified for this mode. In burst-fire mode, a gun rapidly fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled. Firing a weapon in Burst Fire mode is a Simple Action that cannot be combined with any other attack Simple Action in the same Action Phase.

`	`***[Attack] Burst Fire*	 		*Defence Modifier -2	Rounds Used 3	 	Recoil 3***

`	`[Simple Action] A Burst Fire Action fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled.

`	`***[Attack] Aimed Burst*	 *DV +1*		*Defence Modifier 0	Rounds Used 3	 	Recoil 3***

`	`[Simple Action] An Aimed Burst Action fires three bullets every time the trigger is pulled.
#### **Full-Auto (FA)**
` `Weapons that can fire in Full-Auto (FA) mode can throw bullets for as long as the attacker keeps the trigger pulled and the rounds last. Full-Auto weapons can be fired as a Simple Action, firing 6 bullets.

***[Attack] Full-Auto (FA) 		Defence Modifier -4	Rounds Used 6	 	Recoil 6***

[Simple Action] Full-Auto (FA), firing 6 bullets.

***[Attack] Long Full-Auto (LFA) 	Defence Modifier -6	Rounds Used 10	 Recoil 10***

[Complex Action] Long Full-Auto (LFA), firing 10 bullets.
### **Recoil**
Recoil is the effect firing a gun has on the weapon and the wielder. Muzzle rise, wrist strain, body shifting and other factors caused by repeated firing of a weapon are all factors in recoil.

Recoil becomes more of a strain the more bullets you shoot. If you are firing two guns at the same time, shots from the one affect the other, so bullets from each gun add to your total recoil value.

Recoil compensation reduces the recoil penalty. You begin with 1 point of recoil compensation and then add your Strength/3 (rounded up) and the recoil compensation of guns you shoot. Subtract any bullets you’re about to fire from your recoil compensation. If the number is a negative number, that’s your recoil penalty; subtract the penalty from your dice pool before you roll for the attack.

When making multiple firearm attacks in a single Action Phase, calculate the total recoil penalty based on the bullets to be fired that round and remove it from your dice pool before splitting the pool for the multiple attacks.
#### **Progressive Recoil**
Recoil accumulates with every bullet fired until the attacker stops firing to bring the gun (or guns) back under control. Recoil penalties are cumulative over every Action Phase and Combat Turn unless the character takes, or is forced into, a Simple or Complex Action other than shooting. Recoil is cumulative to the character, not the weapon they’re firing. Recoil accumulates from every shot the character takes, not just from the firing of the same weapon.
### **Shotguns**
Shotguns fire slug rounds or shot rounds. Shot rounds spread when fired and the target gets a -1 dice pool modifier for defence at all ranges. To determine the damage done by shot rounds, apply the flechette ammunition rules to the DV indicated for the weapon.



**<a name="_toc218024822"></a>HEALING**\

=======================================
### **First Aid**
**Action: Diagnose** (Complex)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic [Mental].

The gamesmaster sets the threshold as appropriate to the character’s health or affliction and awards information appropriate to the net hits scored.

**Action: Apply Medkit** (Complex)

Skill check: None required.

|**Situation**|**Modifier**|
| :- | :- |
|**Medkit Applied**|+Medkit Rating|
|**Improvised Medical Supplies**|-1|
|**No Medical Supplies**|-3|
|**Good conditions (sterilised med facility)**|+0|
|**Average conditions**|-1|
|**Poor conditions (street or wilderness)**|-2|
|**Bad conditions (combat, bad weather, swamp)**|-3|
|**Terrible conditions (fire, severe storm)**|-4|
|**Patient is Awakened or Emerged**|-2|
|**Patient has Essence Loss**|-1 per 2 full points of lost Essence|
|**Uncooperative Patient**|-2|
|**You are wounded**|-Wound modifiers|

**Action: Stabilise** (Complex, Extended)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic [Mental] (Threshold is total damage accumulated).

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage.

Additional stabilisation tests may be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

Once a character has been stabilised, First Aid, Medicine and/or magical healing may be applied normally.

**Action: Stabilise Wound Penalties** (Complex)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic [Mental].

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

If successful, the wounded patient reduces their total wound modifiers by 1. The character rendering aid can choose to continue until all wound modifiers have been negated. The negation lasts for a number of hours equal to net hits of the test. At the end of that period, wound modifiers return to their normal level based on the remaining amount of damage the character has.

**Action: First Aid Treatment** (Complex \*see below)

Skill check: First Aid + Logic [Mental] (2).

A critical glitch on a First Aid Test increases the damage by 1D3.

Anyone assisting with First Aid should roll their First Aid + Logic. For each assistant that scores at least one hit, the relevant limit for the leader’s test increases by one. Additionally, each hit the assistants make adds one die to the leader’s dice pool. The most dice that can be added to the test is equal to the leader’s rating in First Aid.

An assistant’s glitch prevents that assistant from adding an adjustment to the limit.

An assistant’s critical glitch prevents the leader from receiving any adjustment from any assistants to the limit or dice pool.

Each net hit over the threshold removes 1 box of damage (Stun or Physical).

However, divide the net effect in half (rounded up) if the person being treated is wearing any kind of full-body armour, representing the difficulty of treating a patient through armour.

The maximum damage healable with the First Aid skill is equal to the skill’s rating.

First Aid may only be applied to a character once for that set of wounds, and it may not be applied if the character has been magically healed.

Using the First Aid skill in combat requires a Complex Action and takes a number of Combat Turns equal to the number of boxes of damage the character is healing.

This means the character applying the First aid must spend one Complex Action per Combat Turn providing care but may spend the rest of their Action Phases however they would like.
### **Medicine**
**Action: Diagnose** (Complex)

Skill check: Medicine + Logic [Mental].

The gamesmaster sets the threshold as appropriate to the character’s health or affliction and awards information appropriate to the net hits scored.

**Action: Stabilise**

Skill check: Medicine + Logic [Mental] (3).

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage.

Additional stabilisation tests may be made, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.

Once a character has been stabilised, First Aid, Medicine and/or magical healing may be applied normally.

**Action: Medical Recovery Treatment** (Extended Test)

Skill check: Medicine + Logic [Mental].

Apply appropriate modifiers from the table above.

Each hit provides +1 die to any subsequent healing tests the character makes for healing through rest as long as the character using the Medicine skill spends some time tending to the injured character. For Physical injuries, this is typically at least 30 minutes per day tending to the injuries of the patient. For Stun it is 10 minutes per hours to gain the bonus dice.

The Medical Recovery action may only be applied once to each set of wounds, but it may be applied even if First Aid and/or magical healing have already been used. Medicine cannot be applied in combat situations.
### **Natural Recovery**
**Stun Damage: Body + Willpower** (1 hour) (Extended Test)

The character must rest for the entire hour for it to count (forced naps and unconsciousness also count).

Each hit heals 1 box of Stun damage.

**Physical Damage: Body + Body** (1 day) (Extended Test)

The character must rest for the entire day for it to count (forced naps and unconsciousness also count).

Each hit heals 1 box of Physical damage.

Physical damage cannot be healed through rest is the character also has Stun damage; the Stun damage must be healed first.

A glitch on a healing test (Stun or Physical) doubles the resting time (the damage is still healed – it just takes longer).

A critical glitch increases the damage by 1D3 boxes in addition to doubling the resting time.
### **Medical Patches**
**Administer Trauma Patch: No check** (Simple, Extended)

If placed on a dying patient, this allows them to make an immediate stabilisation test using Body + Willpower (3). If successful, the wounded patient stabilises and no longer takes automatic additional damage. Additional stabilisation tests can be made each round, at a cumulative -2 dice pool modifier per test.
### **Healing Qualities**
**Gifted Healer: 2 Karma**

A character with the Gifted Healer quality is particularly adept at one of Stabilisation, Diagnosis or Treatment. They receive a +1 dice pool bonus whenever performing the selected test, whether by magical or mundane means.

**Quick Healer: 6 Karma**

A character with the Quick Healer quality receives a +2 dice pool modifier to all Healing Tests made on/for/by them, including magical healing.

**Uncanny Healer: 12 Karma**

The character has always been a fast healer, recovering from injuries with almost supernatural speed. Characters who embrace augmentation soon discover that it interferes with their unnatural healing ability, however. The character adds their current Essence attribute as a dice pool modifier to all Natural Recovery healing tests for both Stun and Physical damage. This quality cannot be combined with Quick Healer.
