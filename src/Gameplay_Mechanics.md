# **BASIC GAMEPLAY MECHANICS**

## **Hits & Thresholds**

- *Shadowrun* uses **6-sided dice.**
- The number of dice rolled for any test is determined by the character’s relevant skill – the better they are at what they’re attempting to do, the more dice the player will roll.
- For each die rolled, a result of a **5 or 6 is a “hit”**.
- All tests are rolled against a **threshold** – the number of hits required to succeed, which is proportional to the difficulty of the test. The number of hits must either meet or beat the **threshold** to succeed. An easy test may require 1 hit (i.e. a threshold of 1), the average is 2 and a hard test may require 4.
- Any number of hits rolled in excess of the threshold is referred to as your **net hits**. These can have positive effects such as increasing the damage you do in combat or the speed with which a task is accomplished.

## **Glitches**

- If more than half the dice rolled show a 1, this is a **glitch** – something bad happens.
- It is possible to roll a glitch on a test that has enough hits to be successful. The glitch does **not** cancel the success; instead, the glitch occurs in addition to the success.
- If you roll a glitch and also do not achieve a single hit, this is a **critical glitch** – something extremely bad happens.

>*Note*: The *Close Call* use of Edge can be used to negate a glitch or reduce a critical glitch to a glitch.

## **Limits**

- A **limit** indicates the maximum hits from your initial roll that can be applied to the test.
- Limits are determined by your attributes (see below) or your equipment (see below).

>*Note*: The *Push the Limit* use of Edge can be used to remove the limit from a test.

### **Teamwork Tests**

- Choose a leader for the teamwork test. All others serve as assistants.
- Each assistant rolls the appropriate skill + attribute. For each assistant that scores at least one hit, the limit for the leader’s test increases by one.
- Additionally, each hit the assistants make adds one die to the leader’s dice pool.
- The most dice that can be added to the test is equal to the leader’s rating in the applicable skill or the highest attribute rating if the test involves two attributes.
- If any assistant rolls a critical glitch, then the leader receives no bonus to their relevant limit or additional dice from any of the assistants.
- The leader then rolls their adjusted dice pool and tries to beat the threshold for the test.
