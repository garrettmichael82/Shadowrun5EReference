# **Point Buy**

The Point Buy method has greater flexibility than any other system; the trade-off, of course, is that the complete range of options available can make character creation a somewhat time-consuming process. For many though, the time investment is worth it, as you have the chance to design a character precisely the way you want it to be.

- In the Point Buy system, you **start with 800 Karma** to spend.
- First, select a Metatype, followed by Magic or Resonance type if desired.
- Then spend Karma to buy attributes, skills, qualities and nuyen.
- Nuyen is then spent on lifestyle and gear with a maximum of 5,000¥ remaining at the start of the game.
- Language and knowledge skills, and contacts, are purchased with their own points systems, determined by relevant attributes

# Attributes

## **Minimums and Maximums**

- All characters **start with a score of 1** in all attributes.
- Then add any relevant Bonus Racial Attributes listed in the Metatype Attributes table above.
- At character creation, the natural **maximum for attribute scores 6** unless otherwise specified in the Metatype Attributes table above. Further, at creation, characters may only have **1 Mental or Physical** attribute at this maximum (this excludes Edge, Magic and Resonance).
